Common Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-tables:

Tables
~~~~~~

Views in the form of tables can be considered the most commonly used UI elements in Oro applications. They are interactive, as they not only display data about specific store records, but contain links to these records’ pages. Views are also configurable – so you can adjust the appearance and contents of the tables to your taste and needs.

Such tables represent aggregated views of data and store records, making it easy to locate and manage records, with every grid page functionally tailored to the type of information it represents.

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-location-trail:

Location Trail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the top left corner of the view page, you can see where the current page is located in the menu. The name of the selected view table is usually located in the row below.

**Page Navigation**

If you have a lot of records, they all may not fit in one data page. In this case, use the pager block in the center above the view table.

In the pager block, you can see the page that you are currently on, the total number of data pages and the total number of records in the view table.

.. image:: /frontstore_guide/img/navigation/DisplayOptionsPages.png
