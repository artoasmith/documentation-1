2. Enter the required details in the provided fields. All fields are mandatory:

   * Company Name
   * First Name
   * Last Name
   * Email Address
   * Password
   * Confirm Password

   .. note:: The password must include an upper case letter and a number.

3. Once the details have been provided, click **Create an Account**. A sales representative may contact you shortly to proceed with registration. Check your email to complete registration.

You may need to read and accept :ref:`mandatory (and/or optional) agreements <frontstore-guide--profile-consents>` to process your personal data before you are allowed to register. Such consents are marked with a red asterisk. Select the check box next to the agreement or open the agreement link to view the full text of the agreement. Click **Accept** to confirm that you have read, understood and are accepting its conditions. You do not have to accept optional consents; these are not marked with a red asterisk.
