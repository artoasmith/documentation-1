Update OroPlatform to Oro App
-----------------------------

If you are not sure whether or not you need the full Oro application, you can start
with the OroPlatform application and upgrade it later by installing the ``oro/crm`` and/or ``oro/commerce`` package using Composer:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ composer require oro/crm

        or

        $ composer require oro/commerce
