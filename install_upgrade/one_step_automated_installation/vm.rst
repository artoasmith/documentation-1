   .. note:: In the virtual machine image, the latest released version of Oro application is deployed on the CentOS-7 OS that secures moderate resource consumption.

4. Review the virtual appliance settings and modify resources to meet your server capabilities, if necessary. To do so, double-click on the item and type in the updated value.

5. Once you are happy with the virtual appliance configuration, click **Import**.

   The VirtualBox imports the virtual machine from the image, copies virtual disk drives, and applies the provided configuration.

6. The application opens in a VirtualBox Google Chrome browser window.

   Follow the steps on the screen to start working with the demo instance of the application.
