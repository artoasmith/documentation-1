Using Vagrant Provision
=======================

To get familiar with application functionality or for the development purpose, you can provision Oro application using `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_.

Every Oro application has a *Vagrantfile* that allows you to set up a virtual machine with the running Oro application via a `vagrant up` command.

For example, to set up a VM with OroCommerce CE application locally, run:

.. code:: bash

    git clone -b 1.6.14 https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application.git oroapp && cd oroapp
    vagrant up

After that in several minutes, you'll get the running VM with Oro application that you can access on the URL http://localhost:8000/

The environment in the resulting VM and the provisioning steps automated via the vagrant file that replicates the process described in the :ref:`Manual Installation Guide <install-for-dev>` for the relevant application edition.

For more details on preparing the virtual platform for the virtual machine, please, see the `Installation and Configuration`_ section below.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Windows, MacOS, Linux, or any other OS supported by Virtualbox and Vagrant
* 2048M available RAM on your PC

Installation Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by installing the required software:

1. `Install VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_
2. `Install Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/>`_
3. `Install Git <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git>`_

When you have installed VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Git, do the following:

1. Get the Oro application source code:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone -b 1.6.14 <oro_application_clone_url> oroapp && cd oroapp

Replace the <oro_application_clone_url> with the repository URL for the necessary Oro application:

   .. csv-table::
      :widths: 20, 30

      "OroCommerce Community Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application.git"
      "OroCommerce Community Edition for Germany","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application-de.git"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-application.git"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition for Germany","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-application-de.git"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition (without CRM)","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-nocrm-application.git"

The *branch* value (in this example *1.6.14*) could be changed to another published `release tag <https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application/releases>`_ of the chosen Oro application,
with the following constraints:

   .. csv-table::
      :widths: 20, 30

      "OroCommerce Community Editions v.3.* and above","*branch* value must be greather then 3.0.0-rc"
      "OroCommerce Community Editions v.1.6.*","*branch* value must be greather then 1.6.13"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Editions v.3.* and above","*branch* value should be greather then 3.0.0-rc"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Editions v.1.6.*","*branch* value should be greather then 1.6.13"

Previously published releases of the Oro Applications don't have Vagrantfiles.

.. note:: You can download and unpack the archive with Oro application source code instead of using Git repository. For more information, please, see :ref:`Get the Oro Application Source Code <installation--get-files>`.

2. Configure and run the virtual machine using Vagrant:

   For the Community Editions of the Oro Applications it's enough to run

   .. code:: bash
  
      vagrant up

   For the Enterprise Editions of the Oro Applications also need to specify two parameters:

   - **gittoken** - `Github token <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ to be used for the installation of the Oro applicatoin dependencies (it's required due to the `Github rate limits <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#api-rate-limit-and-oauth-tokens>`_)
   - **licence** - Enterprise Licence key for your Oro Application

   .. code:: bash

      gittoken=39ca9521e1031bfacae976f8d799fa7c54a15edb licence=YourEnterpsiseLicenceKey vagrant up

After the command execution is complete and the setup has finished, you can move on to using the Oro application. Login with credentials described in the `Usage`_ section.

.. note:: When you run `vagrant up` for the first time, the Oro application installation may take some time, as the following time-consuming steps happen:

   * Base CentOS/7 box download 
   * LEMP stack installation on the guest system
   * Installation of composer dependencies for Oro application
   * Oro application installation; note that demo data loading takes extra time.

   The total time for the environment to get up and running depends on multiple factors, like your internet connection speed, CPU frequency, etc. Usually, it takes from 2 to 15 minutes.

Customize Installation Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To customize default installation settings, modify the `Provision configuration` section of the Vagrantfile (please, refer to the commands and inline comments for more information).

The default values for the most important settings are:

**Database settings**

.. code:: bash

   DB_USER=dbuser
   DB_PASSWORD=DBP@ssword123
   DB_NAME=oro

**Application settings**

.. code:: bash

   APP_HOST=localhost
   APP_USER=admin
   APP_PASSWORD=adminpass
   APP_LOAD_DEMO_DATA=y    # y | n (whether to perform loading demo data during installation)

To customize the application hostname:

* Set the new APP_HOST parameter value in the Vagrantfile (e.g. `yourdomain.local`), and
* Map the new hostname to the application host IP address in your local `hosts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)>`_ file, like in the following examples:

  .. code:: bash

     192.168.33.10 yourdomain.local www.yourdomain.local

Now you can open the Oro application in a browser by following the http://yourdomain.local/ URL.

Running Multiple Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single host, ensure that every virtual instance uses a unique forwarded port. Before running an additional instance, modify its forwarded port in the *host* section of the *config.vm.network "forwarded_port"* setting in the Vagrant file.  You can increment the value for every new virtual instance, e.g. **instance A** may have *config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8000* configuration, and **instance B** may get *config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8001*.

Usage
-----

Access the Installed Oro Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the VM setup has finished, you can access the application in your browser with the credentials defined by your installation configuration.

The default login details are:

* *Application URL*: http://localhost:8000/
* *Admin Login*: admin
* *Admin Password*: adminpass

If you have changed the application host, admin login, or password, please refer to the Vagrantfile for these details.

Shared Working Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vagrant maps the working directory on your host machine to the */vagrant* directory in the virtual machine file system.

Once the VM is up, any changes to the files in the host working directory are applied to the */vagrant* directory in the virtual machine file system and vice versa.

.. note::

   For installation, the application source code is copied from */vagrant* folder to the application root folder (*/usr/share/nginx/html/oroapp/*) in the VM file system.

SSH Access to the Virtual Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to the virtual machine via SSH, run the following command in the working directory on your host machine:

.. code:: bash

   vagrant ssh

You will be logged in the virtual machine as *vagrant* user with *sudo* permission (you don't need a password to use *sudo* command).

To configure SSH access to the virtual machine for the utilities that run on the host machine, like IDE, get the explicit SSH credentials by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   vagrant ssh-config

Access Oro Application Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the virtual machine, you can access the DB server using credentials provided in the *Provision configuration* section of
the Vagrantfile. The default credentials are *dbuser:DBP@ssword123*.

To access the database from the host machine, configure and use the SSH connection to the guest machine database server as described in the section above.

Vagrant Ð¡ommands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `vagrant up` -- Creates and configures the virtual machine according to the vagrantfile. Unless the `vagrant destroy` has been launched, on the consecutive runs, `vagrant up` powers on the virtual machine. The provisioning script defined in `config.vm.provision` variable in the Vagrantfile is run only once.

* `vagrant halt` -- Stops the virtual machine and saves the virtual machine image (without the current RAM state) to the host hard drive.

* `vagrant suspend` -- Stops the virtual machine and saves the virtual machine image and the current RAM state the host hard drive.

* `vagrant destroy` -- Destroys the VM and frees the resources of the host machine.

For more information, please see the `official Vagrant documentation <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/>`_.
