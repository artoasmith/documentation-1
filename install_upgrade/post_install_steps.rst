Perform Post-Install Configuration
==================================

Activate Background Tasks
-------------------------

To launch scheduled execution of the operations required by the Oro application, set up a
cron command with the `oro:cron` CLI command as an application entry point (see the sample configuration below).

.. code-block:: text

    */1 * * * * /path/to/php [$folder_location]/orocommerce/app/console oro:cron --env=prod > /dev/null

.. seealso::

    You can also create your own commands that are executed in the background at certain times.
    Read more about it in the :ref:`chapter about executing cron commands <book-time-based-command-execution>`.

Time consuming or blocking tasks should usually be performed in the background to avoid negative impact on the application response time. For example, OroPlatform uses the `MessageQueueComponent`_
together with `MessageQueueBundle`_ to asynchronously run maintenance tasks. Ensure that one or more consumers are always running:

.. code-block:: text

    /path/to/php [$folder_location]/orocommerce/app/console oro:message-queue:consume --env=prod > /dev/null

.. important::

    To ensure that required number of consumers keeps running, set up a supervisor.
    Here is `example of supervisord configuration`_.

.. note::

   If a socket server is running, it checks periodically whether consumers are alive. If no consumers are alive, a flash message notification appears informing users about the consumers' state. The same check is performed upon a user logging in.
