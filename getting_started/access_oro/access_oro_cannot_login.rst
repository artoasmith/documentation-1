The **Account is locked** notification means that your account has been disabled in the system. This is similar to a deleted accountâ€”your can no longer log into the system and other users cannot engage you in the business activities.

**Solution:**

If you are sure that this is a mistake, please contact an administrator.


Credentials Have Expired
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Credentials have expired** notification means that the password reset procedure has been initiated. It could be started manually by an administrator or automatically if your company has a password policy that requires users to periodically change their password. (In the latter case, you might have received notifications reminding you to change your password soon.)

**Solution:**

Please check your email box for the password reset link. You will be able to log into the system after you change your password.


Invalid Username or Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have entered the wrong credentials.

**Solution:**

Try again.


Invalid Username
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/access_oro/login_user_failednotexceeded.png


The password policy of your organization gives you a limited number of login attempts. You have entered the wrong credentials but you still have some attempts left.

**Solution:**

Try again.



Invalid Credentials. The Account Has Been Locked
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/access_oro/login_user_failed.png


The password policy of your organization gives you only limited number of login attempts. You have failed them all and become locked out of the system: you cannot log in, however, your profile is still enabled in the system and other users can engage you in business activities.

**Solution:**

Please contact an administrator. Only an administrator can now activate your account.
