Tags
====

Tags are non-hierarchical keywords or phrases that are assigned to records. They provide additional information about 
records and are visible to all the system users. Tags can be assigned to any records of any entity and used for 
filtering. They can also be used to create a report for only the records that
have/don't have a specific tag, and even generate targeted segments for mailings and marketing campaigns. Moreover, you 
can easily find all records that have a specific tag from anywhere in the system, even if you don't know their other 
details, as described below. 

Add a Tag to a Record
---------------------

You can add a tag from the grid or from a View page of a specific record.

Add a Tag from the Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tag column is available by default on the :ref:`grids <doc-grids>`. If they are not, you can 
:ref:`add the column <doc-grids-actions-change-table>`. Adding a tag is no
different from :ref:`editing other properties from a grid <doc-grids-actions-records-edit>`:

1. Double-click the tag cell of the record.

2. Select one or several of the existing tags from the list, and/or enter a new tag in the field.

   |TagsfGrid|
  
3. Start entering the tag, and only matching tags will be left in the selector.
  
4. If you have entered a new tag, it will also appear in the selector. Select it to add. This way you can add one or several tags that contain one or several words.
  
   |TagsfGrid1|
  
5. Confirm the action.
