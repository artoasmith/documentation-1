Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
======================================

While using OroCommerce, you may sometimes need to inform a user about some events in the system. For example, when an
operation has been executed or has failed, or they need to be reminded about a task or event.

Success flash messages are displayed against a green background:

If something has gone wrong, the flash message will be displayed against a red background in order to attract your
attention.

Other flash messages have a yellow background.

Sometimes, a flash message can contain links to other pages, such as the task reminder above, or this synchronization
message:

Flash messages appear on the top of the screen for several seconds and then disappear.

If the user must make a decision before the system can go on, a dialog window will appear. The dialog windows have
buttons and will not disappear until a decision has been made:
