Explore Your User Page
======================

There are a number of effective tools and actions available on the page of your user profile, from configuring your personal profile to generating an API key for third-party applications. In particular, from the page of your user profile you can:

1. **View your full name, avatar and system information such as status, login count, date and time of the last login.**

   * The first status shows that your are granted rights to use the system. The second status is called an authentication status and shares the state of your password. As you can see your user page only when you are logged into the system, you will always see **Enabled** as the first status and **Active** as the second one. When an administrator views your page, they will able to see the values of your statuses.

   * You can also check which business unit owns your user record. Click on the owner name (e.g. Main) to open the page of the corresponding business unit. If you are logged into the organization with global access (i.e. technical organization that aggregates data from all organizations created in the system), then in brackets you will see the name of organization that owns the user.
