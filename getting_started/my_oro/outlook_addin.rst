Download MS Outlook Add-in
==========================

The Enterprise edition of your Oro application (OroCRM or OroCommerce) supports an out-of-the-box integration with MS Outlook (2010, 2013, 2016). To configure this integration between your Oro Enterprise application and MS Outlook, you need to download the MS Outlook add-in.

The link to the MS Outlook add-in is located in your Oro application instance on the page of your user profile.

To download the add-in:

1. Click **My User** below your username on the top right of the application screen.
2. Next to the MS Outlook Add-in option, click the link to download the file.
3. Open the downloaded file and start the installation process.

 More information on how to setup :ref:`MS Outlook Integration <admin-configuration-ms-outlook-integration-settings>` is available in the relevant MS Outlook Integration topic in the Oro documentation library.
