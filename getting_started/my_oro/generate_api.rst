Generate an API Key
===================

When a third-party software requires an API key to integrate with your Oro application, you can generate it on the page of your profile.

1. Click on your user name on the top right of the screen.
2. Click **My User**.
3. In the **General Information section**, click **Generate Key** next to the API Key label.

4. Copy the generated key and use it where required.

.. caution:: One user can have only one API key at a time. When you generate a new key, the old key becomes invalid.
