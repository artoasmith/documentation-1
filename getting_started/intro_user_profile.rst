.. _user-guide-intro-log-in-edit-profile-synchronize:

Synchronize Your Mailbox with OroCommerce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Emails can be sent from user to user within OroCommerce and outside OroCommerce using internal OroCommerce SMTP server. However, most
OroCommerce users already have some external mailbox used for work-related purposes. You can synchronize this mailbox with
your mailbox in OroCommerce in the **Email synchronization settings** section.

.. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/intro/email_sync_1.png

To synchronize your existing mailbox with your mailbox in OroCommerce, go the the **Email synchronization settings** section.

OroCommerce can be synchronized with any IMAP/SMTP servers. A dedicated **Gmail** synchronization is available to simplify synchronization with Gmail-based accounts.

If synchronization with an IMAP server has been defined, all the emails from synchronized folders of the external
mailbox will be available to you in **My Emails** in OroCommerce. If synchronization with an SMTP server has been defined,
all the emails sent from OroCommerce will be available in the external mailbox.

Please note, that if SMTP synchronization has been enabled, your addressee will always see the mailbox address as the
**from** field value.

.. note::

    If no synchronization has been enabled, emails received from other OroCommerce users will appear in the **Activity**
    section of the **My User** page but not in **My Emails**. Emails from a synchronized mailbox can be reached from the
    both.

Synchronize with any IMAP/SMTP Server
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The functionality can be used to synchronize any IMAP/SMTP server with your mailbox in OroCommerce.

- Select the Account Type - **Other** (if available). If this is an only option enabled for the system, the selector
  won’t be displayed - skip the step.

  |EmailSync2|

* In order to **receive emails** from the external mailbox in OroCommerce:

  - Check the **Enable IMAP** box.

  - Provide your IMAP credentials: host, port, and encryption type (contact your administrator for assistance).

- In order to **synchronize emails sent** from OroCommerce in to the external mailbox:

  - Check the **Enable SMTP** box.

  - Provide your SMTP credentials: host, port, and encryption type (contact your administrator for assistance).

.. hint::

    If you choose not to enable SMTP synchronization, you will still be able to send emails from OroCommerce, but they won’t
    be synced with the email server and you will not see them in other email clients (such as Outlook or Gmail web
    interface). We strongly recommend to enable SMTP at all times.

* In order to **finish the synchronization**:

  - Provide your access credentials: your login/username (usually the email address itself) and password used to access
    the mailbox.

  - Click the :guilabel:`Check Connection/Retrieve Folders` button.

  - Once connection has been established , you will see the list of folders. Check the folders you want to synchronize
    with OroCommerce.

  - Save the user profile.

Syncing with Gmail
""""""""""""""""""

You may use the generic IMAP/SMTP synchronization described above for your Gmail account, however,you must allow access
for **less secure apps** in your Gmail settings first. (Please see detailed instructions
`here <https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en&rd=1#ts=1665018%2C1665144>`_.)

To avoid this step and improve security we strongly recommend to use the dedicated functionality described below.
This section applies to both @gmail.com customers and Google Apps customers.(Check with your email administrator if you
doubt).

- Select the Account Type - **Gmail** and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button that appears below.

  |EmailSync3|

.. note::

    This option is only available if your OroCommerce instance is connected with a Google Apps account. Please check with
    your system administrator if you want to enable Gmail synchronization for your account.

 - If you haven’t used a Google account in your browser (or if its cache has been cleared), the Sign-in form will appear.
   Use it to log in to your account.

   |EmailSyncGM1|

 - If you are using several Gmail accounts in your browser, you will see a list of them. Select the account for which
   you want to enable synchronization with OroCommerce, then log in (if necessary).

   |EmailSyncGM2|

 - As soon as you are logged into a single Gmail account, you need to let OroCommerce view and manage your mail, and give it
   offline access to your mailbox.

   |EmailSyncGM3|

   |EmailSyncGM4|

.. hint::

    Make sure that pop-up windows from your OroCommerce instance are not blocked.


- After the connection has been established, you will see the connected account name (your email address) and the list of
  folders that can be refreshed with the :guilabel:`Retrieve Folders` button.

  |EmailSyncGM5|

Select the folders you want to synchronize and save your user profile. The synchronization will start immediately, but
the full sync can take a while depending on the size of your mailbox.

Change the Synchronized Mailbox
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to change the mailbox you sync with OroCommerce, simply change the IMAP/SMTP credentials for generic IMAP sync,
or remove the connected Gmail account, change your primary email address, and sync with Gmail again.

.. caution::

    If you change the synced mailbox, all emails from the previous mailbox will be deleted from OroCommerce.

Configuring Mailboxes in the Multi-Organization Environment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to work with email in :ref:`multiple organizations <user-guide-getting-started-change-organization>`, you
have to configure a mailbox for every organization. You can synchronize different external mailboxes or the
same external mailbox for your user in different organizations.
