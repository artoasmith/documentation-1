OroPricingBundle
================

OroPricingBundle introduces prices for products in OroCommerce.

For management console users (e.g. sales representatives), the bundle enables the following actions:

* Create overlapping price lists for products manually.
* Generate price lists for the product sets based on custom product assignment rules and price calculation rules.
* Configure the price list visibility for a specific customer, customer group, and website. The visibility settings may be either activated permanently or automatically enabled and disabled based on the scheduled time frames.
