How to fix the UI label of a column?
--------------------------------------

Q: How to fix the UI label of the column that was added to an entity in a migration script. It shows the Oro.Sales.Lead.<myColumnName>.Label instead of myColumnName.

A: The labels for the extended entityâ€™s fields are translatable strings with predefined translation keys (oro.sales.lead.<myColumnName>.label). You need to create the Resources/translations/messages.en.yml file in your bundle and provide a proper translation for this key to display the desired UI label name. For example, *Collector* instead of *Oro.Sales.Lead.Collector.Label*:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    oro:
        sales:
            lead:
                collector:
                    label: Collector


After that, perform the following console command:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    php app/console oro:translation:load --rebuild-cache --timeout=900

The oro.sales.lead.collector.label string acquires the translation provided and is now displayed as Collector.

To update the translation, navigate to **System > Localization > Translations** in the management console of your Oro application.

For more detailed information on how to translate the UI system elements and content to the target language, refer to the related :ref:`System Localization and Translations <sys--config--sysconfig--general-setup--localization>` documentation.


How to change a form type (selection, checkbox, etc) for the values in a column?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to change a form type (selection, checkbox, etc) for the values in a column that was added to an entity in a migration script?

A: The form type for a field can be changed in the **oro_options** array of a particular migration file. Here is an example of a migration script with a checkbox value provided for the form type field:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    class AddCollectorToLead implements Migration
    {
        public function up(Schema $schema, QueryBag $queries)
        {
            $table = $schema->getTable('orocrm_sales_lead');
            $table->addColumn(
                'collector',
                'boolean',
                [
                    'oro_options' => [
                        'extend'    => ['is_extend' => true, 'owner' => ExtendScope::OWNER_CUSTOM],
                        'datagrid'  => ['is_visible' => false],
                        'form' => [
                            'is_enabled' => true,
                            'form_type' => 'checkbox',
                            'form_options' => [
                                'tooltip' => 'some tooltip'
                            ]
                        ],
                    ],
                ]
            );
        }
    }
