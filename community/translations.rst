Contributing to Translation
===========================

.. contents:: :local:

OroCommerce supports localization and internationalization for multiple languages and locales.
All strings that may be translated are defined in the bundle translation domain files and are exposed via the translation
management service `CrowdIn`_ to enable the collaborative translation efforts.

To contribute to OroCommerce translation into your native language:

#. `Join the Translation Team`_.

#. `Submit Your Translations`_.

#. Wait for your translation to be approved.

#. In OroCommerce, in **System > Localization > Languages** section, ensure that synchronization is enabled for the target language. `Contact Oro Translation Team if you Face any Issues`_ (e.g. your translation does not appear in the OroCommerce after it has been approved).

Join the Translation Team

Alternatively, create a new Crowdin account: enter your email, user name, password and password confirmation, and click **Create account**. Follow the link in the confirmation Email to activate you account.

Submit Your Translations
------------------------

#. Select the target language (e.g. Korean).

   Translations are stored in *yaml* files organized by bundles (e.g. OroAlternativeCheckoutBundle, OroCatalogBundle) and by groups (e.g. messages, tooltips).

#. Select the yaml file with the translations you would like to contribute to.

#. Submit your translation. For more information on using Crowdin, please see the `Crowdin tutorial <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/translation-tutorial/>`_.

#. After you have submitted the translation, it will be queued for `proofreading <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/proofreading>`_. Other translators can `vote <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/voting>`_ for it.

#. When the translation is approved, it is marked with a green check and moved to the end of the list on the translation page. Approved translations are merged (published) to the OroCommerce translations once a day and become available in OroCommerce on the **System > Configuration > Language Settings** page.
