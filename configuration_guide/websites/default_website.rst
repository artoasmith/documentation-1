Set a Website as Default
------------------------

OroCommerce redirects anonymous users to the default website. Logged in customers users may be redirected too when their current website is not identified.

To set a website as default:

1. Navigate to **System > Websites** using the main menu.

      :class: with-border

3. On the website details page, click |IcFlag| **Set Default**.

Now the website is marked as default and will be used for the anonymous access.
