Single Page Checkout Workflow
=============================

.. contents:: :local:
   :depth: 1

Overview
--------

In your Oro application, you can control the way the checkout is displayed to customers in the storefront. By default, each checkout step is displayed on a new page. However, by activating the Single Page Checkout workflow in the management console, you can make all steps fit one page. This will make the checkout process easier and quicker for customers, since they will be able to see how far along in the checkout they are, and how many fields are left to complete it.
