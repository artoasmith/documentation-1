   .. important::
      You will be able to add entity records only after you have updated the schema. 


Review an Entity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the main menu, navigate **System>Entities>Entity Management**.

2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, click the required entity.

3. Review the entity settings. Please see details in the `Entity Structure on the Interface <./entity-interface>`__ guide. 
   

Create a Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
   You can add custom fields only for custom entities and extendable system entities.  

To create a field, follow the instructions provided in the `Create a Custom Entity Field <./entity-fields#create-a-custom-entity-field>`__ section.`




Import Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To simplify creation of entity fields, you can create a .csv file that will contain all the required fields with their properties defined and import it into OroCRM/OroCommerce.

.. important:: 
  You can only import data saved in the .csv (comma separated values) format. 

1. In the main menu, navigate **System>Entities>Entity Management**.

2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, click the required entity.

3. In the **Import Fields** drop-down, click :guilabel:`Download Data Template`. The .csv file with sample data will be downloaded.

4. Check that the data you want to import is formatted the same way as in the downloaded template and that the structure of the .csv file you prepared for import is also the same as the structure of the downloaded file.

5. In the **Import Fields** drop-down, click :guilabel:`Import Fields`. 

6. In the **Import Entity Fields** dialog box, click **Choose File**, select the .csv file you prepared and then click **Submit**. 

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_importentityfields1.png

7. Information in the dialog box reloads and the **Import validation results** section appears. Review the information in this section and if you are satisfied with the review results, click **Import**. If you wish to make any changes in the file or upload a different one, click **Back** to return to the previous step. 

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_importentityfields2.png

8. Update the schema to apply the changes. For how to do it, see the `Update Schema <./entity-actions#update-schema>`__ section. 
  

.. _schema-update:

Update Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have defined the necessary entities and their fields, you need to update the schema—the internal structure so that the system could know how the existing fields are interconnected and where to find them.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Update Schema` button in the upper-right corner of the entity view page. 

2. In the **Schema update confirmation** dialog box, click :guilabel:`Yes, Proceed`.


.. note::
  The schema update can take some time, so please be patient.

.. caution::
  Please note that the schema update influences the overall system performance and updates the schema for all the created/updated entities.



Manage Unique Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define a set of fields by which the system will compare entity records to determine whether these records are distinct or not. 


For example, by default you can create two contacts with the same information: 

Jane Roe, born 1985-01-15, \sales@example.com

The system assigns them different IDs and treats them as different records, but they look the same on the interface and actually represent the same person.


Now imagine that before adding contacts you have defined two sets of unique keys:

- First Name+Last Name+Birthday

- First Name+Last Name+Email
  
    
You create a contact:

Jane Roe, born 1985-01-15, sales@example.com

And your colleague Roger tries to add Jane as a contact too: 

Jane Roe, sales@example.com

The system checks: 

- The first names and the last names are the same, but the birthday is different (not specified in the second case), may be these are different contacts.
 
- The first names and the last names are the same, but the email is the same too, so it must be the same contact.

As the result, the system informs Roger that this contact already exists in the system.



To manage unique keys do the following:

1. In the main menu, navigate **System>Entities>Entity Management**.

2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, click the required entity.  
   
3. Click the :guilabel:`Manage Unique Keys` button in the upper-right corner of the page. 
   
4. On the **Unique Keys** page, click **+Add**.

5. Specify the required information:
   
   - **Name**—Mandatory. The set name on the interface. It is used just for reference. 
   
   - **Key**—Mandatory. The fields that will be included in this set. Hold the CTRL key to select several fields. 

6. If you need to add another set, repeat steps 4–5.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_manageuniquekeys.png

7. If you need to delete a set, click the **x** icon next to the set name. 

8. Click the **Save** button in the upper-right corner of the page.      


.. _doc-entity-actions-edit:

Edit an Entity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
  Which properties are editable for system entities depends on the configuration and is based reasonable and safe for the system performance and operation. 

1. In the main menu, navigate **System>Entities>Entity Management**.

2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, choose the entity you want to edit, click the ellipsis menu at the right end of the corresponding row and then click the |IcEdit| **Edit** icon.
   
3. Make the required changes according to the description provided steps 3–6 of the `Create an Entity <../security/entity-actions#create-an-entity>`__ section.   

   .. important:: 
    You cannot change the name of the entity.

    You cannot change the ownership type of the entity.

   There are also several additional fields in the **Other** section that are available only when you edit an entity:

   - **Field Level ACL**—Select this check box to define that permissions can be set on individual fields of this entity. For more information about field level ACLs, see the `Permissions for an Entity Field (Field Level ACLs) <../security/access-management-field-level-acl>`__ guide.

   - **Show Restricted**—Select this check box if you enabled **Field Level ACL** and are going to disable editing of some fields of the entity records but still want users to review disabled fields on the interface. Fields disabled for modifying will appear dimmed on the interface. For more information about field level ACLs, see the `Permissions for an Entity Field (Field Level ACLs) <../security/access-management-field-level-acl>`__ guide.

   - **Searchable**—Defines whether records users can search for and find records of this entity via the :ref:`search in OroCRM/OroCommerce <user-guide-getting-started-search>`.

     - **Yes**—Select this value from the list if users can search for and find records of this entity.
     
     - **No**—Select this value from the list if records of this entity are invisible for search.

   - **Applicable Organizations**—Select in which organizations this entity will be available. The default value is **All**. To specify a particular organization, clear the **All** check box and click the field that appears to choose the organization from the list.
