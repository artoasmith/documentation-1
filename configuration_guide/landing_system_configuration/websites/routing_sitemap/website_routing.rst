Routing Configuration Per Website
---------------------------------

.. begin

To control the way OroCommerce routes HTTP requests to the components when a customer uses particular website, you may provide the following website-specific information:

* Global website URL when reached using secure (https) and insecure (http) connection

* Options that impact the way metadata for the search engine is generated

* Information for the website identification (cookie value and/or environment variable).

.. note:: The website level configuration overrides :ref:`global routing <sys--config--sysconfig--websites--routing>` configuration, when **Use System** box is cleared.

To change the default routing settings for the website:

1. Navigate to **System > Websites** in the main menu.

2. For the necessary website, hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary website and click |IcConfig| to start editing the configuration.

3. Select **System Configuration > Websites > Routing** in the menu to the left.

   The following page opens.

   * **URL** - Internal links and canonical URLs (meta keywords) on the OroCommerce Storefront pages may contain this value as the website base URL. This option value is used in internal links when a customer uses insecure (HTTP) connection. In the canonical links, it is used when the **Canonical URL Security Type** is set to *Insecure*.

   * **Secure URL** - Internal links and canonical URLs (meta keywords) on the OroCommerce Storefront pages may contain this value as the website base URL. This option value is used in internal links when a customer uses secure (HTTPS) connection. In the canonical links, it is used when the **Canonical URL Security Type** is set to *Secure*.

   * **Canonical URL Type** - this option defines whether the *System URL* or *Direct URL* should be used as a canonical link in the meta keywords in the page source code.

     .. note:: Canonical link is used to help search engines identify the unique content that should be indexed.

     When *System URL* is selected, the page URL is built using the system path to the item and its ID (e.g. `/product/view/4`).

     When *Direct URL* is selected, the page URL is built using the page title (e.g. `/500-watt-work-light`).

   * **Canonical URL Security Type** - this option defines which value should be used as a website base URL in the canonical link in the page meta keywords. Supported options: *Insecure* and *Secure*.

     When *Insecure* is selected, the website base URL in the canonical link matches the **URL** value.

     When *Secure* is selected, the **Secure URL** value is used instead.

   * **Web Catalog** - when a Web Catalog is selected, it populates the main menu and sub-menus on the OroCommerce Storefront. If there is no Web Catalog in OroCommerce, the Master Catalog structure is mimicked.

   * **Cookie Value** - a unique website ID that is saved in the cookies and is later used by a website matcher to identify the website customer is on. The cookie name is configured on the :ref:`system level <sys--config--sysconfig--websites--routing>`.

   * **ENV Variable Name** - an environment variable that is used to store the unique website ID that is later used by a website matcher to identify the website customer is on.

   * **ENV Variable Value** - a unique website ID that is saved to the environment variable with the name defined in the option above.

4. To customize any of these options:

     a) Clear the **Use System** box next to the option.
     b) Select the new option.

5. Click **Save**.
