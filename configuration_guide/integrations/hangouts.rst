Voice and Video Calls via Hangouts
==================================

With the Hangouts integration feature, you can call via Google Hangouts directly from Oro application. This means that sales team
can make calls to their customers and prospects directly from Oro application, making it faster than ever to make and log your
sales calls. This feature is also great for support teams, as they can contact customers and utilize the screen sharing 
function for necessary support cases. Additionally, it can be used for internal communications (meetings and 
discussions), as it is possible to hold a session with up to five Oro application users. Moreover, integration with Oroâ€™s
Calendar allows users to pre-arrange a meeting and then quickly launch a call from the event page.

- Have the Hangouts extension installed in Oro application as described in the
  :ref:`Extensions and Package Manager Guide <admin-package-manager>`

- If you are using a browser other than Chrome, install a Google Hangout or Google Talk extension for 
  the browser.
