The list of the ticket will open.

Click on the individual ticket to expand its details. You can always add comments and attachments to the ticket and review the responses from the support team.

Share Support Requests in Your Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To keep multiple people in your organization informed of the support requests and their progress, you may request Oro support to create you an Organization group and include the accounts that should have shared access to the tickets.

Once the group is created, and one of the grouped accounts proceeds to the ticket creation, the new field is added to the request details where they can specify if the request should stay *private* or be *shared with the group*.

Mark the Ticket as Resolved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the support team has provided you with a solution, please mark the ticket as resolved by clicking the Resolved link on the top right of the ticket details.

Support Request Priorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your request may be assigned one of the following priorities:

* Priority 1 (P1) issues are those that cause the complete unavailability of the production application or the inability to use mission-critical functionality within the application. For P1, there are no workarounds. Example of P1 issues: the application is down or not available to the end users, or data loss or data corruption occurred making an essential part of the application unusable, etc.

* Priority 2 (P2) issue is a serious problem within the application where a major feature/function failure has occurred. The application is functioning but in severely reduced capacity, or the problem is causing significant impact to some of the customerâ€™s business operations and productivity, or the application is exposed to potential loss or interruption of service.

* Priority 3 (P3) issue is a medium-to-low impact problem that involves partial or non-critical loss of functionality, or that impairs some operations but allows a customer operations to continue to function.

* Priority 4 (P4) is reserved for general use questions, cosmetic issues, and documentation-related questions. With P4, the application works without any functional limitation.

* Enhancement Request (ER) is a recommendation for future product enhancement or modification to add official support and documentation for the unsupported or undocumented feature, or features that do not exist in the application.

Support Request Statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your request may be in one of the following statuses:

* **Waiting for triage** is a status of the new ticket that just entered the queue.
* **Request acknowledged** is set when a ticket has been acknowledged by the support team and is waiting for the proper resources to be assigned.
* **In progress** is the status of a ticket where an investigation and solution is currently being worked on.
* **Waiting for customer** is a status for tickets that require some additional information form your side. This could be additional access, some specific question related to the request, or any other point where the ticket is on hold but not because of the support team.
* **Resolved** status means that the problem or question has been resolved and the reporter has confirmed it may be closed or is no longer relevant. The ticket may also enter this status if no feedback on the advised solution or answer is received for a long time after several follow-ups.
* **Reopened** is a status where a ticket has been reopened due to some additional questions or issues discovered on a request.
