Add a Product Page (Web Catalog Content)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Product page node is a direct link to the product details in OroCommerce Store Front.

To add a product page node to the menu on the OroCommerce Store Front:

#. Select the **Add Product Page** in the Content Variants list.

   The following section shows:

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/web_catalogs/WebCatalogCreateContentVariantsProductPage.png
      :class: with-border

#. Select the product from the list. To use search, start typing the product name or SKU in the box. To use filtering, click on the **bars**, and select the filtering conditions in the *Manage filters* section.

#. This step applies only to the content nodes with more than one content variant.

   When your product page is not selected as a default variant for the content node, there is a *Restrictions* section beneath the selected product. In this section, you can define the condition when the product details override the default content variant. See :ref:`Configure Content Visibility <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>` section for more information.

#. Click **Save** when you are done filling in the web catalog content node or keep adding the content variants.
