""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Category node is a direct link to the product category with the list of products in OroCommerce Store Front.

To add a category node to the menu on the OroCommerce Store Front:

#. Select the **Add Category** in the Content Variants list.

   The following section shows:

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/web_catalogs/WebCatalogCreateContentVariantsCategory.png
      :class: with-border

#. Select the category from the product catalog tree. To use search, start typing the category name in the box. Use **>** and **v** to expand/collapse the tree node.

#. This step applies only to the content nodes with more than one content variant.

   When your category is not selected as a default variant for the content node, there is a *Restrictions* section beneath the tree of categories. In this section, you can define the condition when the selected category overrides the default content variant. See :ref:`Configure Content Visibility <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>` section for more information.

#. Click **Save** when you are done filling in the web catalog content node or keep adding the content variants.
