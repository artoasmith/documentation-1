#. In the page that opens, fill in the details of the **homepage node** of the web catalog as described in the :ref:`Set Up the Homepage, First Level Menu, and Sub Menus <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--root-node>` section.

   The content selected in the content variants of the **homepage node** is shown when the buyer navigates to the OroCommerce storefront. The **homepage node** also acts as a parent node for the web catalog menu and sub menu items. It is recommended to use Oro Frontend Root system page as a root node of your web catalog.

#. Under the **homepage node**, create main menu content nodes (e.g. first level of the main menu in the storefront) as described in the :ref:`Set Up the Homepage, First Level Menu, and Sub Menus <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--root-node>` section. It is recommended to create a dedicated landing page for main menu nodes of your web catalog.

Once the main menu nodes are saved, create **sub-menu content nodes**. These will be shown as the second level of the main menu in the OroCommerce storefront:

#) Ensure that the appropriate main menu node is selected in the content nodes structure to the left.

#) Click **Create Content Node** on the top right of the page.
