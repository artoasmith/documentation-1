Set Up a Default Content Variant
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The first content variant that is added to the node is marked as the default variant.

When you add more content variants, they have a dedicated restrictions section next to the content variant details. These restrictions will limit the use of this content variant only to specific cases; the default option is used in any other case.

To set up a newly added content variant as default, select the radio on the top left of its type.
