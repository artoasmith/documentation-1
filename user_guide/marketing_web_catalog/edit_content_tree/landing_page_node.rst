Add a Landing Page (Web Catalog Content)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Landing Page node is a link to the :ref:`custom content page <user-guide--landing-pages>` created in the **Marketing > Landing Pages** section.

To add a landing page node to the menu on the OroCommerce Store Front:

#. Select the **Add Landing Page** in the Content Variants list.

   The following section shows:

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/web_catalogs/WebCatalogCreateContentVariantsLandingPage.png
      :class: with-border

#. Select the existing landing page from the list. To use search, start typing the keywords in the box to search for the necessary page. To use filtering, click on the **bars**, and select the filtering conditions in the *Manage filters* section. Alternatively, you can create a new landing page:

   #) Click **+** to the right from the Landing page list.

      The Create Landing Page pops up.

   #) Fill in the landing page details and contents as described :ref:`here <user-guide--landing-pages-create>`.

#. This step applies only to the content nodes with more than one content variant.

   When your landing page is not selected as a default variant for the content node, there is a *Restrictions* section beneath the selected landing page. In this section, you can define the condition when the landing page overrides the default content variant. See :ref:`Configure Content Visibility <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>` section for more information.

#. Click **Save** when you are done filling in the web catalog content node or keep adding the content variants.
