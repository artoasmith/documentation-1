Add a System Page (Web Catalog Content)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

System page is one of the standard pre-designed pages of OroCommerce Store Front (e.g. Requests for Quotes, Open Orders).

To add a system page to the menu on the OroCommerce Store Front:

#. Select the **Add System Page** in the Content Variants list.

   The following section shows:

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/web_catalogs/WebCatalogCreateContentVariantsSystemPage.png
      :class: with-border

#. Select the system page from the list.

#. This step applies only to the content nodes with more than one content variant.

   When your system page is not selected as a default variant for the content node, there is a *Restrictions* section beneath the selected system page. In this section, you can define the condition when the system page overrides the default content variant. See the :ref:`Configure Content Visibility <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>` section for more information.

#. Click **Save** when you are done filling in the web catalog content node or keep adding the content variants.
