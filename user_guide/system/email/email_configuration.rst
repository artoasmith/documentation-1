Configuring IMAP/SMPT 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IMAP and SMTP are protocols used for mail delivery.

-  **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol) allows to retrieve email messages, while

-  **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) allows to send them out.

To retrieve your mail from a mail client and sync data into OroCRM, as
well as synchronize emails sent from OroCRM into your mailbox (so you
can see them in other email clients):

-  Check :guilabel:`Enable IMAP and Enable SMTP.`

-  Fill in the following fields: **IMAP and SMTP Host, IMAP and SMTP
   Port, Encryption (SSL, TLS)**.

-  Click :guilabel:`Check Connection/Retrieve Folders.`

-  After successful connection, a list of folders will be loaded.

-  Check the folders that you wish to be synchronized (e.g. Inbox).

As an example, we have synchronized a Gmail mailbox with OroCRM, having previously turned on **access for less secure apps**. More details on how to synchronize your Gmail and turn on access for less secured apps can be found `here <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en&rd=2&visit_id=1-636180891016092253-2149088408#ts=1665018%2C1665144>`_  `and here <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en>`_

-  Click :guilabel:`Save Settings` in the top right corner to save your configurations.

Google integration 
-------------------

The only integration available in the community edition by default is
integration with Google:

-  Navigate to **System** in the main menu and click :guilabel:`Configuration`.

-  In the left menu, click :guilabel:`Integrations>Google Settings`.

Here, you can define the details used for Google single sign-on which
allows a user with the same Google account email address and OroCRM
primary email address to log-in only once in the session.

|

.. image:: ../img/admin_emails/google_sign_on.jpg

|



See how to configure Google Sign-on integration in the :ref:`Google Integration guide <user-guide-google-single-sign-on>`.

MS Exchange integration
-----------------------

OroCRM Enterprise Edition supports integration with Microsoft Exchange
server. This means that emails from mailboxes on the MS Exchange server
can be automatically uploaded to OroCRM.

This functionality enables using a single system-wide setting to collect
letters of multiple users within organization.


|

.. image:: ../img/admin_emails/ms_exchange.png

|



The integration set-up is described in the
relevant :ref:`MS Exchange guide <admin-configuration-ms-exchange>`.

Microsoft Outlook Integration
-----------------------------

Integration with Microsoft Outlook is available for the OroCRM
Enterprise Edition only. 

|

.. image:: ../img/admin_emails/ms_outlook.jpg

|

The integration allows automatic
synchronization of all the contacts. Tasks and calendar events available
for the user can be synchronized with the specified Outlook account and
vice versa. The integration set-up is described in the relevant :ref:`Outlook Integration guide <user-guide-synch-outlook>`.

.. note:: Please note emails are not synced in the course of Outlook integration. For that, please, refer to `Standard personal mailbox configuration (IMAP/SMTP)`_ section.

Configuration of system mailboxes

To create a system mailbox to process business information requests:

-  Navigate to **System** in the main menu, click :guilabel:`Configuration`.

-  Next, click :guilabel:`Email Configuration` on the left in the **General
   Setup** menu.

-  At the bottom of the page, you will see a section where you can
   create and configure a system mailbox.
