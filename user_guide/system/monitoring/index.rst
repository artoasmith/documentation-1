In Oro applications, you can use the embedded tools to monitor tasks, jobs, and processes.

* :ref:`View jobs in the Message Queue <book-job-execution>`
* :ref:`View scheduled tasks <book-time-based-command-execution>`
* Use Data Audit --- users who are entitled to use data audit by their role permissions, can view change history and an aggregated report of the changes (``data audit``) that were applied to the application data. Change history and data audit are traced for the auditable items only.
