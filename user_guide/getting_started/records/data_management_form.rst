In order to create a new record of an :term:`entity` or to update details of the existing record, use the dedicated **Create <Entity name>** and **Edit <Entity name>** pages.

Create a Record
---------------

1. On the **All <Entity name>** page (the page with the list of all entity records), click **Create <Entity name>** on the top right. The **Create <Entity name>** page opens.

   .. note::

    The default list of fields available on the page can be modified by an administrator.

    .. Referred doc is yet missing in OroCommerce: For more information, see the description of the **Show on Form** field in the Entity Field Properties <doc-entity-field-properties>` guide.

2. Fill in all the required information. 
   
   Note that mandatory fields are identified with the red asterisk.

   Available fields are usually gathered into logical sections. Click the section name to scroll the page to the fields that belong to this section.

3. Save the new record or discard it. 
   
   To save the record, click one of the options in the save menu on the top right:
  
   - :guilabel:`Save`—Save the changes and stay on the **Create <Entity name>** page. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the record configuration.   
   
   - :guilabel:`Save and Close`—Save the changes and close the **Create <Entity name>** page. The record view page opens.
   
   - :guilabel:`Save and New`—Save the changes and open a new **Create <Entity name>** page. The blank **Create <Entity name>** page opens. Use this option if you want to immediately create another record. 
   
   To discard the changes, click the :guilabel:`Cancel` button in the upper-right corner of the page.
