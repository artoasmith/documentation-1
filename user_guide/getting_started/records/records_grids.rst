A ``grid`` is an aggregated view of all the entity records. Each row of a grid is one record, and columns represent record fields.

.. _doc-grids-open-grid:

Open a Grid Page
----------------

There are several ways to get to a grid.

- Via the :ref:`main menu <user-guide-navigation-menu>`.

  For instance:

  - In the main menu, navigate **Customers>Contacts**. This will bring to to the **Contacts** grid.

  - In the main menu, navigate **Customers>Manage Custom Reports**. This will bring to to the **Reports** grid.
 
  
- Via the :ref:`shortcuts menu <user-guide-getting-started-shortcuts>`.

- Click the grid link on the entity record :ref:`view page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>`
  or :ref:`create / edit page <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>`.

 .. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/data_management/grid/grid_from_view.png

.. hint::

    If you have reached a view page or create / edit page from a grid, and now click link to get back to the grid, it
    will look identical to when you left it (the same filters and order will still be applied).


.. _doc-grids-grid-page:

Grid Page
---------


.. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/records/grids/grids_grid.png



At the upper-left of the grid page you can see where this page is located in the menu. In the next row you can see a name of the selected grid view. You can open another grid view from the drop-down menu next to the grid view. You rename, delete, etc. the current grid view. For more information about grid views and how to manage them, see :ref:`Manage Grid Views <doc-grids-grid-views>`).

At the upper-right of the grid page, you can see records action buttons. Via them you can perform certain actions with records. The set of these buttons varies depending on which entity grid is opened.

Then follows a filters block. If this block is hidden, but some filters are applied, you will see the filters summary. For more information about filters see :ref:`Apply a Filter <doc-grids-actions-filters>`.

In the next row there are grid action buttons that enable you export grid, modify its settings, and, between them, a pager that enables you navigate between data pages.


.. _doc-grids-actions-pager:

Navigate Between Data Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a lot of records, they may not all fit in one data page. In this case, use the pager block that you can see in the center above the grid.

In the pager block, you can see the page that you are currently on, the total number of data pages, and the total number of records in the grid.


.. image:: /user_guide/img/getting_started/records/grids/grids_pager.png


You can navigate between pages using the :guilabel:`<` **Previous Page** and :guilabel:`>` **Next Page** buttons.

To open a particular page, type its number in the field that displays the current page and press **Enter**.


.. _doc-grids-actions-refresh:

-------------

.. note::

    The default data grid settings define whether to paginate data in grids, how many items to show per page, and what maximum number of pages can be shown.
    They also define whether to the top of the grid page will be locked so that you will be able to see the page name, data headers, etc. at any moment when you scroll.

    Usually these settings are defined by a system administrator for the whole OroCRM/OroCommerce application. Check whether you have access to the personal configuration: in the user menu, look for the **My Configuration** item. If the access is granted to you, see the **Data Grid Settings** for how to configure basic data grid settings.

.. _doc-grids-grid-views:

Manage Grid Views
-----------------

A ``grid view`` is a a grid with applied filters or custom ordering. By default, each grid has a grid view called **All <Record Name>** (e.g. **All Accounts** or **All Calls**). This grid view shows unfiltered data. For some entities, additional default grid views exist (e.g. **Open Leads** for leads, **Duplicated Accounts** for accounts).

If there is a frequent set of filters and / or ordering that you need to use, save them as a custom grid view. You can have any number of additional grid views. This is very convenient when you are working with customers from different stores, contacts from different states, and so on.
