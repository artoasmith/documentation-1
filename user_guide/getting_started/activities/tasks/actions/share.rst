When you share a task with a user, this user will be able to view this task even though they may have no permissions to do it otherwise. For example, according to your company settings, users can see only tasks assigned to them. However, you and your colleague work on the same project and you want them to see your tasks in order to avoid duplication of effort. In this case, you can share tasks with your colleague.

Depending on you application settings, you can share tasks with other users, other business units, or other organizations.
