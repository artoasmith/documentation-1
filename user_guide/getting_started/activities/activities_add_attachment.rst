Attachments
===========

You can add an attachment to a record in OroCRM and OroCommerce.

.. important::
    By default, the list of activities available for each entity is determined by what is most commonly used by businesses. However, if your company's work process requires it, you can always turn the desirable activity on for almost any entity (except technical ones). If you need particular activities to be enabled for an entity, contact your administrator, or see steps 4 and 5 of the :ref:`Create an Entity <doc-entity-actions-create>` action description
    
.. hint::

    The attachment settings depend on the specific entity settings. See step 5 of the :ref:`Create and Entity <doc-entity-actions-create>` action description.


Add Attachments
---------------

Once a record has been created, an attachment can be added from its View page.

.. caution::

   The ability to view and upload attachments depends on the permissions
   defined for the entity.

1. Go to the record view page.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Add Attachment` action button (it can be nested under **More Actions** on the top right).

   - Leave a comment, if necessary.

   - Define the attachment owner. 
     

   .. note:: Only the owner is able to manage and view the attachment, unless certain users were assigned roles that give them permissions to manage/view this owner's attachment.
