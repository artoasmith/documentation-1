.. important::
   By default, the list of activities available for each entity is determined by what is most commonly used by businesses. However, if your company's work process requires it, you can always turn the desirable activity on for almost any entity (except technical ones). If you need particular activities to be enabled for an entity, contact your administrator or adjust the activity entity settings if you have the corresponding permission.
    


Manage Attachments
------------------

.. note:: Only the owner is able to manage and view the attachment, unless certain users were assigned roles that give them permissions to view/manage the owner's attachment.
