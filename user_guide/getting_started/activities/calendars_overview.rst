System and Organization Calendars
=================================

In your Oro application, you can add calendars with tasks and events related to a specific user, other users in the system
(subject to the :ref:`roles and permissions defined <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`), as well as events 
defined for the whole organization or system.

Events in the System and Organization calendars can be viewed by all the users within the system/organization.
The ability to create, edit, and delete events depends on the user's :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` and :ref:`capabilities <admin-capabilities-org-calendar-events>`.

.. note:: See a short demo on `how to create and manage calendars <https://www.orocrm.com/media-library/create-and-manage-calendars#play=fVcOy3TmuQg>`_, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.
