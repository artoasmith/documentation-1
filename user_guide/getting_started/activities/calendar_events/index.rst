Calendar Events
===============

In OroCRM and in OroCommerce Management Console, you can create and monitor planned activities as calendar events. These planned activities may be linked to the related data in OroCRM and OroCommerce (e.g. a demo may be linked to the opportunity in OroCRM and to the request for quote in OroCommerce).

Please see the :ref:`short overview of calendar events <doc-activities-overview-events>` for additional details.

When managing calendar events, you can do the following: (see aggregated information :ref:`here <doc-activities-events-actions>`):

* :ref:`Create <doc-activities-events-actions-add-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`View <doc-activities-events-actions-view-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Edit <doc-activities-events-actions-edit-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Delete <doc-activities-events-actions-delete-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Reschedule <doc-activities-events-actions-changetimeframe>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Manage context <doc-activities-events-actions-context-detailed>` of a calendar event.
* :ref:`Comment <doc-activities-events-actions-comment-detailed>` on a calendar event.
* :ref:`Respond to the invitation <doc-activities-events-actions-respond-detailed>` to the calendar event.
* :ref:`Start a Hangout event <doc-activities-events-actions-hangout>` (available only when the google integration is enabled).

You can perform most of these actions while working with:


* The :ref:`list of calendar events <doc-activities-events-grid>`, also known as the `calendar events grid`.

* The **Activity** section of the related itemsâ€”records in OroCRM and OroCommerce that are related to the customer user activity and have been added as a calendar event context. By default, the event may be set to be related to opportunity, quote, customer user, contact, account, lead, business customer, case, request for quote, and order records.
