When viewing a calendar in the **My Calendar** page on in the **Today's Calendar** widget, you can change the event time frame.

Change the event start time by dragging the event to the new time slot: click the event in the calendar, hold the mouse button, and drag the event to the desired time.

Change the event duration by extending the event: hover over the bottom of the event box for **=** to show, and drag it to fill the desired time frame.
