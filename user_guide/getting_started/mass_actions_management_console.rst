Mass Actions in Management Console
----------------------------------

With mass actions, you can apply one action to multiple items at the same time, which can simplify and speed up the process of selecting the required items.

In the management console, mass actions are available for tables where information is displayed as a list.

As an illustration, you can have a look at how mass actions work for accounts:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Accounts** in the main menu.

   The following page opens:

3. To select multiple accounts, click |Bdropdown| in the left corner of the list header.

   * The **All** option enables to select all the accounts available under this section.
   * The **All visible** option enables to select only the accounts visible on the page you are currently viewing.
   * The **None** option enables to deselect all the accounts which were selected previously.
