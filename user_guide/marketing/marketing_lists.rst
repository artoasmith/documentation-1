Marketing Lists
===============

With Oro application, you can automatically generate a marketing list of contacts that will be used for marketing purposes (mass call or mailing). For example, you can create a list of personal and contact details of customer users who registered after October 1 and whose shipping address is in California.

With marketing lists, you can run :ref:`Email Campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>` in Oro application. You can also synchronize Oro application Marketing lists with Subscribers Lists in :ref:`MailChimp <user-guide-mc-integration>` and Address Books in :ref:`dotmailer <user-guide-dm-integration>`.

Marketing lists may be based on the contacts from the following items:

* Accounts (via primary email of default contact)
* Customer users
* Quotes (via customer user email)
* Orders (via customer user email)
* Shopping lists
* Business Customer
* Lead
* Contact

Marketing activity may be monitored in the context of these items, in the Marketing Activity section.

Create Marketing Lists
----------------------

To create a new Marketing List:

#. Click **Create Marketing List**.

   The Create Marketing List page opens.

      :header: "Field", "Description"
      :widths: 10, 30

      "**Name**","Name used to refer to the marketing list in the system."
      "**Entity**","Choose an entity from the drop-down.
      Only entities that have contact details (E-mail or phone number) are available.
      Records of the chosen entity and entities related to it will be used to create the list of contacts."
      "**Type**","Chose the list type from the drop-down:

      - **Dynamic** lists are updated as soon as any changes have taken place in the system.

      - **On demand** lists will be updated only following the user request
        (click |BRefresh| to refresh the table on the view page of the marketing list record)."
      "**Owner**","Limits the list of users that can manage the marketing list to the users, whose roles allow managing marketing lists of the owner (e.g. the owner,

   More information about the ways to define filters is provided in the :ref:`Filters Management <user-guide-getting-started-filters>` guide.

   The contacts that match the filter condition will be automatically subscribed to the Mailing list. You can later unsubscribe a contact or remove them from the mailing list.

#. In the **Columns** section, define the set of fields that will be shown in the Marketing List details on the general page for every target contact.
