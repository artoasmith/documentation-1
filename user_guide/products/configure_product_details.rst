Configure Product Details
-------------------------

You can control the way product information is structured, as well as what default and custom blocks it contains for a particular type of products. The products of the same type belong to the same product family and share the same product information (set of product attributes). A special price attribute helps you store the price related information that may be easily reused when you plan you prices on the website.

Product Information Structure
-----------------------------

When you create a product, you bind it to the product family. It may define additional group of attributes shared among the multiple products of the same type (e.g. software vs services, heavy industry equipment vs fashion products).
