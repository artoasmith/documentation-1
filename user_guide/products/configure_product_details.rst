Configure Product Details
-------------------------

You can control the way product information is structured as well as what default and custom blocks it contains for a particular type of products. The products of the same type belong to the same product family and share the same product information (set of product attributes). A special price attribute help you store the price related information that may be easily reused when you plan you prices on the website.
