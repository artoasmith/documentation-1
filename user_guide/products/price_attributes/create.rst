      :class: with-border

#. Type in the price attribute name (that is used as a UI label) and the field name that is used in the code and in the database to refer to the price attribute container.

#. Select the currencies that are supported for this price attribute:

   * Click the currency to select only one of them.

   * Hold the ``Ctrl`` key and click another currency to add it to the selection.

   * Hold the ``Shift`` key and click another currency to select a range of currencies.

#. Click **Save**.
