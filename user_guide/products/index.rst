Products
========

OroCommerce enables you to create and manage products in the way that fits specifically your business strategies and requirements. As it may not be obvious where to start working with your product, several dedicated sections have been compiled to help you understand the full picture of creating and manging products, as well as some additional aspects that working with products may involve. 

It is suggested to start off with the :ref:`Understand Products' Life Cycle <doc--products--before-you-begin>` section to familiarize yourself with the product cycle in OroCommerce. 

Continue to the :ref:`Create Products <doc--products--actions--create>` section to find out how to create different types of products (simple and configurable) and how to set up a matrix form to display multiple variations of one configurable product in the storefront.

To learn more about the ways to control visibility of the products you created for specific customers, customer groups or websites, navigate to the :ref:`Manage Product Visibility <products--product-visibility>` section. Here, you will learn how to set up specific visibility settings, as well configure visibility priorities.

Refer to the the :ref:`Manage Products: Core and Advanced Actions <doc--products--characteristics>` section to learn about the actions available for products, such as duplicating or importing, as well as how to manage product quantities in multiple warehouses on the product page.

To learn how to associate your products with specific brands and create them in the management console, head for the :ref:`Use Product Brands <user-guide--product-brands>` section.

Review the ways to define the look of your product page in the dedicated :ref:`Manage Product Page Design with Page Templates <user-guide--page-templates>` section. 

Configure the visual elements to improve the way products are represented in the storefront, as described in the :ref:`Highlight and Illustrate Products <doc--products--manage-inventory-prices-look>` section.
