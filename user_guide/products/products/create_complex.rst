Create a Configurable Product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. start


Checklist 
^^^^^^^^^

Prior to creating a configurable product, ensure that you have performed the following steps:

1. Created :ref:`Attributes <products--product-attributes--create>`.
   
   A configurable attribute is one of the product attributes that are used to distinguish :ref:`product variants <products--products--product variants>` of the same configurable product. There should be at least one configurable attribute specified for the configurable product in order to enable a customer to select product variants.

2. Created a :ref:`Product Family <product--product-families--create>`.
   
   As a configurable product and all of its variants share the same set of attributes, they should share the product family as well.

3. Created :ref:`Configurable Product Variants (Simple Products) <products--products--create-simple-product>`.
   
   A configurable product may group several simple products, or configurable product variants whose information mostly overlaps except for several product attributes. It means that you have to create a simple product for each variant that you need to add to the configurable product.

Sample Configurable Product 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sample flow below shows all steps required for the creation of a configurable product.

*Product: Red and green hats, sizes S and M.*

**Step 1. Create Attributes.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Product Attributes** in the main menu. 
2. Click **Create Attribute** in the upper-right corner.
   
   We will create two attributes, one after another: 'HatColor' and 'HatSize'.
3. Select the type of an attribute. 
   
   Currently *Select* and *Boolean* types are available for configurable attributes. We will use *Select* for both attributes. 

4. Fill in required information and add the necessary options for the attributes by clicking **+Add**. 
   
   For 'HatColor', attribute options will be 'Red' and 'Green'.

      :class: with-border

   For 'HatSize', attribute options will be 'S' and 'M'.

      :class: with-border

5. Click **Save** to save the attributes.

.. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleHatColorSizeGrid.png
   :class: with-border

**Step 2. Create Product Family.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Product Families** in the main menu. 
2. Click **Create Product Family** in the top right corner.
3. Fill in required information and add attributes 'HatColor' and 'HatSize' to the attribute group by clicking **+Add**.
   
   Each attribute must have a separate group in our case.
   
   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleProductFamily.png
      :class: with-border

4. Click **Save** to save the product family.
   
   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleProductFamilyGrid.png
      :class: with-border

**Step 3. Create Configurable Product Variants.**

We now need to create one configurable product variant (simple product) per each variant that we would like to have available in the configurable product. Since we have two attributes, 'HatSize' and 'HatColor', and each attribute has two options ('S'/'M' for the first and 'Red'/'Green' for the second), we need to create four simple products.

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product** in the top right corner.
3. Set the product type to *simple*, select the 'HATS' product family.
4. Fill in required information and add attributes required for this particular product.

      :class: with-border

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleSimpleProduct2.png
      :class: with-border

5. Click **Save**.
   
Perform step 3 for all four simple products. 

.. note:: Make sure that all your simple products are *enabled*.

   :class: with-border

**Step 4. Create a Configurable Product.**

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product**.
3. Set the product type to *configurable*.
4. Select the category.
   
   .. note:: Choosing category is mandatory at this stage, as it determines whether the product is available on the website.

5. Choose the 'Hats' product family.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleCreateConfigProduct.png
      :class: with-border

6. Add 'HatSize' and 'HatColor' attributes to the product.
7. Fill in required information and add the created product variants for this configurable product.

   .. note:: You might want to save the product at this point to make sure that product variants are available in the **Product Variants** section of the product you are creating.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleProductVariantsForConfigProduct.png
      :class: with-border

8. Click **Save**.
   
   .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/SampleConfigSimpleGrid.png
      :class: with-border

The product should now be available on the website in the category we have previously assigned it to.
