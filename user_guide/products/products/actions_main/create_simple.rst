         :end-before: simple_product_end

4. Select the :ref:`product family <products--product-families>` to define the product options and details that will be filled in the following steps.

5. Place the product under the necessary category in the master catalog by clicking on the category. Use search to limit the list of categories.

6. Click **Continue**.

   The product details page appears.

7. In the **General** section:

   a) Enter the product SKU, name, description, and short description that best positions the product for your target audience.

      .. note::

         * A description is a detailed information about the product that appears on the product view.
         * A short description appears in the catalog listing.

         Use the WISIWIG editor to format the information.

   #) Enter a URL slug that is used to build a human-readable URL for the product page on the storefront.

   #) Configure units of quantity:

      .. image:: /user_guide/img/products/products/ProductsCreate_Units0.png
         :class: with-border

      * In the **Unit Of Quantity** list, select the main product unit that is shown by default when you view the product details in the storefront. Available options: *each*, *item*, *kilogram*, *piece*, *set*.

      * In the **Precision** field, set the acceptable precision (number of digits after the decimal point) for the quantity that a user may order or add into the shopping list. Items and sets are usually whole numbers, and units like kilograms may get precision of 2 to allow buying a custom volume (e.g. 0.5 kg).

      * Click **+ Add** to add more than one unit of quantity.

           :class: with-border

        For every additional unit, provide precision and conversion rate compared to the main unit of quantity.

        Select the **Sell** check box to enable selling product in these units. Unless **Sell** is selected, the unit is considered to be a draft.

        You can delete the unnecessary unit of quantity by clicking the |IcClose| **Delete** icon next to it.

   #) In the **Tax Code** list, select the :ref:`product tax code <taxes--product-tax-code>` that defines the percentage of tax that may be included into the purchase order during the checkout.

      The tax calculation process depends on the tax jurisdiction that you decided to use in OroCommerce and other tax calculation options.

   #) For **Brand**, select a :ref:`brand <user-guide--product-brands>` from the list. Use |IcBars| to view the list of all available brands. To create a new brand, click **+**.

You can select whether the image will be shown as *main* (the image is used in the product details view), *listing* (the image is shown in the catalog listing), or *additional* (additional product pictures). All three categories can be selected at the same time. To remove an image, click the |IcClose| **Delete** icon next to it.
