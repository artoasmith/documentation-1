Bind a Product to a Product Family
----------------------------------

.. begin

Every product may be bound to one `product family </user_guide/products/product_families>`_. The default one contains generic product attributes (e.g. SKU, name, description, metadata, etc.) A custom product family contains the generic product attributes and any number of custom attributes organized in groups.

.. TODO add screen

When creating a new product, after you select a custom product family and click **Continue**, the default and custom product attributes are shown as tabbed groups between the standard *General* product details and before the *Inventory* details. Depending on the attribute type each attribute has corresponding input (date picker, file, text area, select).
