Dashboards
==========

Dashboard is a default page you see after you log in. It is an adjustable view that may contain many types of information blocks (widgets),
such as today's calendar, recent calls and emails, quick launchpad, etc. You can have several dashboards that serve different purposes and switch between them.

In this section you will learn how to easily customize existing dashboard or create a new one.

Create a Dashboard
------------------

To create a dashboard:

#. Hover over the |IcDashboard| in the main menu and click **Manage Dashboards**.
  
#. Click **Create Dashboard** on the top right of the page.

   The following page appears:

   The following fields are mandatory and **must** be specified:

   .. csv-table::
     :header: "Field", "Description"
     :widths: 10, 30

     "**Label**","Name used to refer to the dashboard in the system"
     "**Clone from**","Choose an existing dashboard to be used as a base for a new one.
     This is convenient, if two dashboards don't differ much, or if one of them is an extended version of the other one (e.g.a dashboard sharpened for the aims of a usual sales manager and for the head of the sales department).
     If you want to create the dashboard from the scratch, choose the option *Blank Dashboard*."
     "**Owner**","Limits the list of users who can manage the dashboard to the users, whose roles allow managing dashboards of the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, head of the department, etc.)."

#. To save the dashboard, click **Save and Close** in the top right corner.

Initially, the dashboard contains all the widgets of the dashboard it has been cloned from. Dashboards cloned from the Blank Dashboard will be empty.
