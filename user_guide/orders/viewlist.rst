Order List

The following information about orders is available:

* **PO Number** --- Another order reference number. It is usually defined by the buyer and used by the buyer's side to match invoice and received goods with purchase.
* **DNSLT** (Do not ship later than) --- The date on which the order expires.
* **Currency** --- The currency in which the order is made.
* **Subtotal** --- The amount due for items included in the order. Does not include additional costs, taxes, discounts.

   To handle big volume of data, use page switcher, increase the 'view per page' value, or use |IcFilter| filters to narrow down the list to the information you need.
