.. _doc--orders--actions--archive:

Archive an Order
================

.. important:: This operation is available only for orders with status *Closed*.

After you make sure that no further actions with an order are required (the buyer is not going to send a return request, etc.), you can archive the closed order. Archived orders are old orders stored for historical purposes only.

To archive an order:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **Sales > Orders**.
#. Filter the order list by internal status to show only closed orders.
#. Choose the order you want to archive in the filtered list and click it. The order details page opens.
#. Click the **Archive** button on the top right of the page.

The order :ref:`internal status <doc--orders--statuses--internal>` becomes *Archived*.
