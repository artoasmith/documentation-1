* **DNSLT** (Do not ship later than) --- The date on which the order expires.
* **Currency** --- The currency in which the order is made.
* **Subtotal** --- The amount due for items included in the order. Does not include additional costs, taxes, discounts.

.. hint::

   To manage the columns displayed within the grid, click |IcConfig| on the right of the grid, and select the information you wish to be displayed.

   To handle the big volume of data, use page switcher, increase the 'view per page' value, or use |IcFilter| filters to narrow down the list to the information you need.

   .. For how to configure visible fields, a number of items per page, etc., see the :ref:`Grids <doc-grids>` topic.

At the top right you can see the name of the view. The views are defined by default:

* Open Orders --- Shows only orders with status 'Open'.
* All Orders --- Shows all existing orders regardless of their statuses.

To change the view, click the drop-down next to the view name and select the required view.
