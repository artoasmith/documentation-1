Pricing
=======

Price list management is one of the most important aspects of any e-Commerce business and even more so for Business to Business (B2B) e-Commerce
companies. B2B businesses require a high level of flexibility to support the most advanced use cases, including a highly structured approach to account management and versatile sales processes that are often customized to the needs of specific customer groups or large individual accounts. This is why OroCommerce has one of the most advanced price list management features.

Overall, price management in OroCommerce enables you to:

* Set up flexible product prices for different websites, customer groups, and customers.
* Assign prices for newly added products automatically.
* Schedule temporary or permanent price changes.
* Override the automatically assigned price with the manually adjusted value.
