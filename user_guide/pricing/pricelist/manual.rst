.. begin_one

You can add a product price in the specific currency to the price list manually in one of the following ways:

* While editing a product, in the **Product Prices** section of the product details.

* When viewing the price list details, by clicking **+ Add Product Price**.

.. note:: The ability to add product prices from the price list and product pages depends on the *Create* role permission for the Product Price entity. If it is set to *None* for a particular role, adding prices will not be permitted for a user with this role. Please see the :ref:`Understand Roles and Permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` topic for more details.

#. Select the product to add the price for.

   To illustrate how price tiers work, let us consider the following example:

   When the product prices in USD are provided for one item, ten items, and fifty items, and a buyer orders 20 items, they will see price provided for ten items.

#. Select the unit of quantity for the price.

#. Type in the price value and select the necessary currency from the list next to it.
