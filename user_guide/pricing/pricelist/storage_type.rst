Use Only Fields with Table Storage in Filtering Expressions
===========================================================

In filtering expression for the price assignment rule, you can use only fields stored as table columns.

Serialized fields cannot be used in the filtering expressions for price lists.

To check a storage type of a field:

#. Navigate to **System > Entity > Entity Management** in the main menu.
#. Click the required entity in the list to open it.
#. Scroll down to the **Fields** section, find the required field, and check its **Storage Type** property.
