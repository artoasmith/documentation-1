Product Tax Code is a label that is assigned to a product or product group and indicates the tax obligations and exemptions customers have when they purchase this product. These tax obligations are taken into account when a customer (user) submits an order.

The sections below provide guidance on managing product tax codes, using them to label products and bind products to dedicated tax rules.
