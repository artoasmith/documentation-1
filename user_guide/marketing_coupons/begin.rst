Before You Begin
----------------

.. start

As coupons are linked to promotions, make sure that :ref:`promotions <user-guide--marketing--promotions>` are enabled in your system. For more information on configuration of promotions, see the relevant :ref:`Configure Promotions <sys-config--commerce--sales--promotions>` topic, or refer to your administrator.

Enabling promotions allows you to perform the following actions with coupons:

1. See **Coupons** under **Marketing > Promotions > Coupons** in the main menu of the management console.
2. View and add coupons to :ref:`orders <user-guide--sales--orders>` in the management console.
3. Apply coupons in :ref:`shopping lists <frontstore-guide--shopping-lists>` and :ref:`checkout <frontstore-guide--orders>` in the storefront.

Coupons can be created manually or generated. Usually, you *create* coupons manually when you need a small number of them (e.g. 2), or *generate* coupons when you need many (e.g. 1000).
