Create a Quote
--------------

.. begin_create_quote

You can create a quote based on the customer request for quote, or from scratch, based on the customer interaction outside OroCommerce.

* :ref:`Create a quote from scratch <quote--create-from-scratch>`

* :ref:`Create a quote from an RFQ <quote--create-from-rfq>`

If you are using your OroCommerce application with OroCRM, you can create a quote from an open opportunity related to a Commerce Customer once you activate the OroCommerce Opportunity Flow:

* `Create a quote from an opportunity <https://oroinc.com/doc/orocrm/current/user-guide-sales-tools/b2b-sales/opportunities#orocommerce-opportunity-flow>`_
