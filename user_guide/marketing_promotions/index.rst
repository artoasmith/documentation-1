Promotions
==========

Companies often develop loyalty programs offering special discounts to customers who have bought from the company before, follow them in social networks, or have commented on their website. This can motivate customers to buy more and repeat purchases from their stores, making promotions one of the most efficient strategies when it comes to converting shoppers to buyers.

In your Oro application, you can configure promotions, apply various discount options for orders or line items, add and generate :ref:`coupons <user-guide--marketing--promotions--coupons>`, manage discounts in placed :ref:`orders <user-guide--sales--orders>`, view them in :ref:`shopping lists <frontstore-guide--shopping-lists>` in the management console.

The following topics will delve into how to view, create and manage promotions in your Oro application:
