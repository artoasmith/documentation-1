Apply Multiple Discounts to an Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin_apply_multiple_discounts

When items in the order qualify for multiple discounts, several promotions or coupon codes can be added to it.

However, please keep in mind that:

* Application of promotions to orders may be subject to the sort number (priority) assigned to the promotions and whether any of them have **Stop Further Rule Processing** enabled.
* You cannot use two coupon codes for one order if they are part of the same promotion.

Promotion can be applied to the existing order in two ways:

* **By creating a new promotion**.

   If there are no available promotions applicable to the items from the order, you need to :ref:`create a new promotion <user-guide--marketing--promotions--create>` with the necessary products added to it. Once you open the order edit page, the created promotion will be added to the order automatically and will be displayed in the **Promotions and Discounts** section under **All Promotions**.

* **By applying an existing promotion**.

   If the promotion applicable to the order items was created after the order had been placed, it will be added automatically once you open the order edit page. This promotion will be displayed in the **Promotions and Discounts** section under **All Promotions**.

The following illustration is an example of multiple discounts applied to one order:
