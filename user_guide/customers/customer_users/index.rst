Customer users act on behalf of the company and may have a limited set of permissions in OroCommerce, depending on their function in the customer organization.

For customer user management, navigate to **Customers > Customer Users** in the main menu.

In Customer Users section, you can:

* View, edit, and create new customer users.
* Select their roles in OroCommerce to define their level of permissions and access to the actions and data in OroCommerce storefront.
* Manage customer user information (name, birthday, billing and shipping address, and phone number, etc).
* View requests for quotes, quotes, sales orders, and shopping lists created by the customer user.
* View communication with the customer that happened using email, notes or scheduled events.
* View additional information attached to customer user.
* Enable and disable the customer.
* Reset the customer user password.
* Add OAuth applications

.. note:: You can delegate this function to the customer who will access user and role management in the OroCommerce storefront (see the :ref:`Delegating Users and Role Management to the Customer <user-guide--customers--customer-user-delegate>` section for more information).
