In a landing page, you can:

.. * Capture additional customer data that helps you segment customers and offer them more personalized services and products in future.

* Describe a service or product in a compelling way that leads to the informed buying decision and moves your customer one step closer to the purchase.

.. * Expose an opt-in offer (e.g., join the offline event).

* Share a promo (e.g., use a promo code to get 10% discount off the *Winter items*).

* Offer an ebook download, webinar registration, or notification of a new product line launch in exchange to registering an account in your eCommerce website.
