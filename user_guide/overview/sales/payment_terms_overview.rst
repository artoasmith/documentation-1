A payment term describes the conditions under which a seller will complete a sale (e.g. the period allowed to a buyer to pay off the amount due).

In **Sales / Payment Terms** section, you as a sales person can view, edit and delete the custom payment terms and enable/disable them as payment option for customer(s) and customer groups(s).
