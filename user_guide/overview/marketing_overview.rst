In OroCommerce, you can manage the navigation look and feel of the OroCommerce storefront, create multiple customer login pages and landing pages for your marketing campaigns.

When OroCommerce is bundled with OroCRM, you can also efficiently organize and monitor marketing campaigns and mailings from the Oro Management Console:

* Automate Marketing Lists generation.
* Use Marketing Lists to generate an Email Campaigns in the Oro application and external systems (Dotmailer and MailChimp).
* Create contact lists with customers who have added an item to a cart in an integrated eCommerce store (OroCommerce, Magento), but have not yet submitted the order.
* Track the user activity on the eCommerce storefront (OroCommerce, Magento).

All the Tracking and Email Campaign details can be treated independently or aggregated within a Marketing Campaign.
