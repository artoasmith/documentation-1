Product Variants
================

.. begin

Product Variants are items that slightly vary from each other (in one or more attributes), and are presented together as a single Configurable Product for customer convenience. A product variant usually shares most of the characteristics with the main configurable product (and other variants of the same configurable product) except for the value of a several product attributes that distinguish this variant from other variants. A configurable product and all of its variants should belong to the same Product Family (so they have the same set of Product Attributes). Product variants have their own SKUs, may have they own inventory and price settings, and may generally be treated as separate products in product information management UIs.

For example, a T-Shirt may be available in various sizes and colors (e.g. Red T-Shirt XL, Red T-Shirt XXL, Green T-Shirt XL, Green T-Shirt M). In this case, the generic T-Shirt is a configurable product, Red T-Shirt XL, Red T-Shirt XXL, Green T-Shirt XL and Green T-Shirt M are product variants, and Size and Color are Configurable Attributes that define this relationship.

Configurable Attribute - is one of the Product Attributes that are used to distinguish product variants of the same configurable product from each other. There should be at least one configurable attribute specified for the configurable product in order to allow the customer to perform product variant selection.

Matrix Order Form - is a UI (UI element) that allows for ordering (specifying quantities and adding at once) of multiple product variants.

Product Type - is a property of a product that determines the way how this product's information is managed and displayed, including additional functionality available for some product types. Configurable Product and Simple Product are examples of the product types.

Simple Product - is a type of products that have their SKUs, and can be associated to Configurable Products as their product variants.
