A product attribute is a special type of custom field in the product details. For product attributes, OroCommerce enables you to manage and group attributes that are unique to a special product family. By adding the product attributes only to the product families they fit, you can limit the product data to the necessary characteristics.

For example, when your OroCommerce store sells TVs and T-shirts, these items share some generic attributes (e.g. name, vendor), and differ in the remaining attributes set. For example, there might be a *Screen properties* group that contains *resolution*, *diagonal*, and *matrix* that should be linked to the products in the TV product family. For the T-shirts family, the linked attribute group may have color, size, material, fit and care guidance (washing, ironing, dry cleaning, etc).

By default, OroCommerce comes with the following system product attributes:

Add new product attributes to introduce new custom parameters in your product details. Include product attributes into the new or existing attribute group in one or multiple product families.

.. note:: System attributes are shared among all product families. You can reorganize the way system attributes are grouped, but you cannot remove a product attribute from the product family.
