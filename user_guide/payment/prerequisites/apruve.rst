Before adding Apruve as a payment method in OroCommerce, you need to create an Apruve business account and a dedicated API key via the official Apruve website.

The role in the Apruve system is determined by the way you participate in a particular transaction. There are two different roles:

   "**Shopper**", "The person shopping for products or services and selecting the Apruve payment method during the checkout."
   "**Merchant**", "The person who owns the store."

Create a Test Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OroCommerce Apruve configuration offers you a possibility to select a test mode to test your store first and ensure that the integration is working properly. Test mode activation should be performed on both sides.

On the OroCommerce side, you need to enable the test mode when setting up the integration by selecting the **Test Mode** check box (see :ref:`Apruve Payment Method Integration <user-guide--payment--configuration--payment-method-integration--apruve>`).

On the Apruve side, you need to follow the https://test.apruve.com link and create a test account. This test account is identical to the https://app.apruve.com regular one but exists only as a test environment that can be used for exploring the Apruve software and its functionality without any risks of the money being charged.

Additionally, the Apruve test account provides the ability to create test credit cards and bank accounts (see `Add Bank Account Information`_ for details).

To create an Apruve test account, proceed with the following steps:

1. Log into the https://test.apruve.com with the credentials generated at the stage of registering a business account.

   .. note:: You can change the credentials any time by navigating to **Settings > Profile** in the main menu on the left.
