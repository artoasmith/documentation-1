Add a Consent Landing Page to a Web Catalog
-------------------------------------------

.. note:: To add the consents to a web catalog, make sure that consents are :ref:`enabled in the application <configuration--guide--commerce--configuration--consents>`. 

To be able to display the text of the consent to customers in the storefront, you need to create a consent landing page with the corresponding description and add it as a content variant for a specific node in a web catalog.

.. important:: Please be aware that if your consent does not require any descriptive text, or if your consent is optional, you do not have to add it to the web catalog node as a landing page. However, if you need to :ref:`comply with the GDPR <user-guide--consents>`, make sure that the mandatory consent has detailed description of the terms that the buyer should agree to, in which case you do need to add this consent as a landing page to the selected web catalog node.

To add a consent landing page to a web catalog content node:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Web Catalogs** in the main menu.
#. For the necessary catalog, hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary catalog, and click |IcEditContentTree| to start editing the catalog content tree.
#. Click on the required root content node where you want the consent to be displayed.

   .. note:: When **navigation root** is enabled in the system configuration, you can store all consents outside of the main navigation tree which allows to hide consents from the main menu in the storefront.

   .. .. note:: If you do not want the consent to be displayed in the storefront menu, add it to the 5th menu level to hide it from the storefront, or apply appropriate :ref:`restrictions <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>`.

 .. since by default only the first 4 levels are visible on the storefront

#. In the **Content Variants** section, click **Add Landing Page** in the Content Variants list.

#. Select a landing page with the consent description from the list, if such landing page has been created previously under **Marketing > Landing Pages**.
 
   To create a new landing page from within the web catalog, click **+** next to the hamburger menu in the Landing Page field.

#. In the dialog that opens, provide the following key details:
    
   * **Titles** --- Provide the name for the consent and translate it into the languages supported in your OroCommerce configuration. 

     To manage title translations, click |IcTranslations| next to the **Titles** box and follow the guidance :ref:`in the Translations and Localizations section <localization--localization>`.

   * **Content** --- Provide the consent description. The text that you enter will be displayed to customers in the storefront.

   .. note:: You can read more on creating and managing landing pages in the corresponding :ref:`Landing Pages <user-guide--landing-pages>` topic.

#. Click **Save** at the bottom of the dialog to save consent details. 

   The consent is now added to the Landing Page content variant field.

   .. important:: Be aware that web catalog restrictions can affect the visibility of the consent in the storefront. Make sure that the visibility restriction are configured properly. Read more on restrictions in the :ref:`Set Up Content Variant Visibility topic <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>`.

#. Click **Save** on the top right to save the content node.

Once the landing page with the consent description is added to a web catalog node, you can :ref:`create a new consent <user-guide--consents--create>` under **System > Consent Management**, and link it to the required web catalog node.

.. important:: Keep in mind that for the consents to be displayed in the storefront, you need to :ref:`add them to the list of enabled consents <admin--guide--commerce--configuration--customers--consents--enable--globally>` in the system configuration.

.. important:: You can view all consents accepted by your customer users in the **Consents** section of their pages under **Customers > Customer Users**.
