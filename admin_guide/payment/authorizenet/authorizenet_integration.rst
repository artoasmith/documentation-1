3. In the **Basic Information** section, provide the following information:

   * **Short label** --- The payment method name/label that is shown in the order details in the OroCommerce management console and storefront after the order is submitted. To translate the label into other languages, click on the |IcTranslations| icon next to the field.

Supported types are *Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, JCB, Diner's Club, and China Union Pay*. Press and hold the **Ctrl** or **Shift** key and click on the items to select multiple card types.

5. In the **Integration** section, provide the following information:

   .. note:: For more information on IDs and keys, see the :ref:`Get Authorize.Net Credentials Required for Integration with OroCommerce <user-guide--payment--prerequisites--authorizenet-credentials>` topic.

   * **No Account? Sign up here** --- Click the link to `create a merchant account with Authorize.Net <https://reseller.authorize.net/application/101898/>`__ (if you have not set up an account yet).

     .. important:: Select this check box only if you turned on the Card Code Verification (CCV) security feature on your Authorize.Net merchant interface. If a card code is not required, hiding the CVV field from buyers helps them keep their card code safe.

8. In the **Advanced Settings** section provide the following information:

   * **Payment Actions** --- Select one of the options for credit cards:

     - *Authorize* --- The payment gateway checks with the cardholder's issuing bank that the submitted card is valid and that there are sufficient funds to cover the transaction. The required amount is placed on hold on the card but not yet charged. To charge the amount, you must perform the *capture* action in the order details. This is usually done after the order is shipped or ready to be shipped.

       .. note:: You have 30 days to capture the payment.

     - *Authorize and Charge* --- The payment gateway checks the card with the cardholder's issuing bank and, if everything is OK, initiates a money transfer from the card to your account. This payment action is recommended when the order is fulfilled immediately after the purchase (e.g. for digital goods sales).

       .. note:: *Authorize and Charge* is the only payment action available for eCheck payments.

9. In the **Other** section, provide the following information:

   * **Status**  --- Set the status to **Active** to enable the integration.
   * **Default Owner** --- A user who is responsible for this integration and manages it.
