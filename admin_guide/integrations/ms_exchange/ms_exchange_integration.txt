To set up an integration between your Oro application and MS Exchange Server, define the settings on the MS Exchange Side and the Oro application side.

MS Exchange Side 
----------------

You need Microsoft Exchange Server version 2007 or newer.

The administrator of the Microsoft Exchange Server account must create at least one user with the permission to impersonate necessary accounts on the related Exchange Server (super-user).

The impersonation procedure is different subject to a specific MS Exchange version. It is described in detail in the relevant documents from the `Microsoft API and reference catalog <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library>`_
(for example, this is the `document <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn722376(v=exchg.150).aspx>`_ for Exchange Server 2013).

Oro Application Side
--------------------

To configure MS Exchange integration settings in your Oro application:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration > System Configuration > Integrations > MS Exchange**.

   The Enterprise edition of Oro applications supports integration with Microsoft Exchange server. This means that emails from mailboxes on the MS Exchange server can be automatically uploaded to the Oro application.

   This functionality enables using a single system-wide setting to collect letters of multiple users within organization.
