Google Integration
==================

All Oro application editions support the integration with Google. With its help, you can configure Google single sign-on to enable users with the same Google account email address and OroCRM/Commerce primary email address to log in only once in a session. Additionally, you can configure oAuth2 with Google for email synchronization, and set up Google Hangouts calls.
