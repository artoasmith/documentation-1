Create and Manage Organizations
===============================

An organization represents a real enterprise, business, firm, company or another organization, to which users belong. In |oro_application| Community Edition, only one organization is available in the system, and you cannot create more. In |oro_application| Enterprise edition, you can create as many organizations as necessary.

6. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the organization is available on the list of all organizations under **System > User Management > Organizations**, where you can filter them by name, edit organizations, and access configuration settings.
