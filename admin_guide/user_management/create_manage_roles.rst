Create a Role
-------------

To create a new role in |oro_application|:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Roles** in the main menu.    
2. Click **Create Role** on the top right.
3. In the **General** section, provide the role name.

4. In the **Additional** section, specify the following:

   * **Description** --- Use the built-in text editor to format the provided description.
   * **Organization** --- Select the organization that the user role belongs to. 
   
     .. note:: If you want this role to be applicable for all organizations defined in the system, do not specify any organization. In this case, the field value becomes **System-wide**. If there is only one organization defined in the system or you do not have global access rights, there is no option for selecting an organization.
     
5. In the **Entities** section, you can set three types of permissions - entity-level, field-level and system capabilities:

   * To specify access levels for entity-level permissions, click on the arrow icon next to the required permission (e.g. create or assign), and select the access level from the list. By default, access levels for each permission are set to **None**.

     To set the same access level for all actions on entity, select the required access level from the ellipsis menu at the end of the entity row.

   * To specify access levels for :ref:`field-level permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles--field-level-acl>`, click **+** to the left of the entity name. Click on the arrow icon next to the required permission, and select the access level from the list. Read more on how to enable field-level permissions in the :ref:`Apply Permissions to Entity Fields <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles--apply--field-level-acl>` topic.

6. In the **Workflows** section, specify access levels for workflows and workflow transitions. There are two permissions for workflows, **view** and **perform transitions**. By default, all workflow access levels are set to **None**. Choose the workflow or the transition to which you want to assign different permissions, click on the action name and select the required access level from the list. 

   .. tip:: If you do not see individual transitions of the workflow, click the **+** **Expand** icon in front of the workflow name to expand the list of transitions.
