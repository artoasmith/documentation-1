Entity Field Properties
=======================

.. contents:: :local:
    :depth: 3


The creation of an entity field takes two steps. In step 1, you specify just the very basic properties: name, field type and field storage type. In step 2, you specify more advanced properties, some of which can be field-type-related.

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Field Name**","Mandatory. Type a name of the field that will be used to refer to it in the system. 
  
  This name must be unique within an entity. 
  It cannot be a `reserved SQL word <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189822.aspx>`_ , nor a
  `reserved PHP word <http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.keywords.php>`_."
  "**Storage Type**","Mandatory. Select how the field is stored in the system. There are two options:

  - **Serialized field**—Use this storage type for simple fields that keep information necessary for 
    a single entity. The field will appear in the system as soon as it has been added and no :ref:`schema update <schema-update>` is required.
  
    .. important:: 
      Serialized fields cannot be used for :ref:`grid filters <user-guide--business-intelligence--filters-management>`, report and chart generation, data audit, creation of :ref:`segments <user-guide--business-intelligence--filters-segments>` and :ref:`relations <user-guide-entity-management-relation>`.
  
      Serialized fields cannot be used for files, multi-selects or option sets.
  
  - **Table column**—Store field values to a database table. If this option is selected, the field can be used without the limitations applicable to a serialized field. For this type of fields a :ref:`schema update <schema-update>` is required.
  "
  "**Type**","Mandatory. Select a field type from the list.
  
  The following types are available:

  - Fields
  
    - BigInt  
    
    - Boolean
    
    - Currency
    
    - Date
    
    - DataTime
    
    - Decimal
      
    - File
    
    - Float
    
    - Image
    
    - Integer
    
    - Multi-Select
    
    - Percent
    
    - Select
    
    - SmallInt
    
    - String
    
    - Text
    
  - Relations—Relation is a field that enables you to tie record(s) of one entity to record(s) of another entity. For example each customer has an account, and each account can be assigned several contacts.
  
    - Many to many
    
    - Many to one
    
    - One to many
  
  For the help on selection the field that is right for your purposes, see the `Entity Field Types <./entity-fields-types>`__ guide.

Advanced Entity Field Properties
--------------------------------


Properties that can be defined may vary subject to the chosen field type. 

The following sections provide descriptions of common properties (they are applicable to most of the types), and peculiarities of specific types.

Common Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fields **Name**, **Storage Type**, **Type** that you filled in when specifying information for basic entity field properties (see the `Basic Entity Field Properties <./entity-field-properties#basic-entity-field-properties>`__ section) are still present on the page but they are read-only now, i.e you cannot change their values.

There are two new fields in this section:

.. csv-table:: 
  :header: "Field","Description"
  :widths: 10,30

  "**Label**","Mandatory. Type a label that will be used for referring to the field on the interface. By default, the label is the same as **Name**."
  "**Description**","Type a short but meaningful description that will appear as a field tooltip on the interface."

  "**Column Position**","Type a number that corresponds to the position of this field in the .csv file that contains entity records."

  "**Exclude Column**", "- **No**—Select this value if you want this field to be available for export.

  - **Yes**—Select this value if you do not want this field to be available for export (this field will not be present in the .csv file obtained as a result of the export operation)."

  "**Available in Email Templates**","If this option is set to *Yes*, values of the field can be used for creating email patterns."
  "**Contact Information**","Possible values are:
    
    - Empty—The field will not be treated as a contact information.
    - **Email**—Email address will be treated
      as contact information.
    - **Phone**—Phone number will be treated as contact information.

  "
  "**Show on Grid**","If set to *Yes*, the field will be displayed in a separate column of the respective grid."
  "**Show Grid Filter**","Not available for serialized fields. If set to *Yes*, a corresponding filter will be added to 
  :ref:`grid filters <user-guide--business-intelligence--filters-management>` by default."
  "**Show on Form**","If set to *Yes*, the field value appears as editable on record edit pages."
  "**Show on View**","If set to *Yes*, the field is displayed on record view pages."
  "**Priority**","Defines an order of custom fields on entity record view, edit, and create pages, and on the respective 
  grid. 
  
  Custom fields are always displayed one after another, usually below the system fields. If no priority is defined or the 
  defined priority is 0, the fields will be displayed in the order in which they have been added to the system. The fields with a higher priority (a bigger value) will be displayed before the fields with a lower priority."
  "**Searchable**","If set to *Yes*, the entities can be found with
  the :ref:`search <user-guide-getting-started-search>` in OroCRM/OroCommerce by values of this field."
  "**The Search Result Title**","If set to *Yes*, the field value will be included into the search result title."
  "**Auditable**","Not available for serialized fields. If set to *Yes*, the system will log changes made to this field values when users edit entity records."
  "**Applicable Organizations**","Defines for what :term:`organizations <Organization>` the custom field will be added 
  to the :term:`entity <Entity>`.
  
  **All** is selected by default. Clear the **All** check box to choose specific organizations from the list."


.. caution:: 

      If the **Show on Form** value has been set to *No*, there will be no way to create/update the field values from 
      OroCRM/OroCommerce. Thus, such configuration is reasonable only for data which is uploaded to the system during a synchronization.

|                            | These could be a couple of important details in edition to the title which give you the most important information about the related entity record.                                                   |

Example
"""""""
Let us create a field **Friend** that relates to contacts that were recommended by a specific business customer. This is a 'one to many' relation, as one business customer may advise many friends.

Our **Friends** field has the following values:

- **Target Entity**—Select **Contact**.

- **Related Entity Data Fields**—Select **Description**, **Gender**, and **Job Title**.
 
- **Related Entity Info Title**—Select **First name** and **Last name**.

- **Related Entity Detailed**— Select all the fields available.


.. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_field_example_newfield.png


Now we create a business customer:

The following grid appears once you have clicked the :guilabel:`+Add` button against the **Friend** field on the record edit or ceate page:


.. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_field_example_bc1.png


It contains all the fields defined for the **Related Entity Data Fields**.

We have added three contacts. We have added three contacts. The title contains properties defined for the **Related Entity Info Title**. **Related Entity Data Fields** are displayed for each record below the link.


.. image:: /user_guide/img/admin/entity_management/entity_field_example_bc2.png


If you click the title of one of the opportunities, a dialog box with all the details specified in the **Related Entity Detailed** appears.

The **Related Entity Info Title** properties are also used to represent the related contacts on the view page.
