Up-sell products listed for the product in the OroCommerce storefront may advertise more expensive alternatives to the product, like a newer and more advanced model, upgrades and add-ons that may look tempting when bundled with the product, etc.

In the system configuration, you can:

* Enable and disable up-sell product management for the products.
* Limit the number of items displayed as up-sell.

These settings may apply :ref:`globally <sys--commerce--catalog--upsell-products>`, on the :ref:`organization level <sys--users--organization--commerce--catalog--upsell-products>`, and on the :ref:`website level <sys--websites--commerce--catalog--upsell-products>`.

   In the **Up-Sell Products** section, the following options are available:

   * **Enable Up-Sell Products** --- Toggles managing up-sell products on/off. Enabled by default.
   * **Maximum Number Of Assigned Items** --- A limit of related items that may be added to any product.
   * **Maximum Items** --- A limit of up-sell products that are shown to the buyer.

     .. note:: Some related items may be hidden by the visibility settings. If the list of up-sell products still exceeds the limit, only the specified number of items (top of the list) will be shown.

   * **Minimum Items** --- The minimum number of up-sell products that may be shown to the buyer. If the actual number of products is less than this value, the up-sell products section is hidden in the storefront for the product.
   * **Show Add Button** --- Enables a buyer to order the product from the up-sell products section in the main product details. When disabled, a buyer needs to open the up-sell product details before they can add it to the shopping list.

     **Show Add Button is Enabled**
