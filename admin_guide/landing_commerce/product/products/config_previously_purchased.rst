Previously Purchased Products
=============================

The previously purchased products page displays the products that were recently purchased by customer users. In the storefront, this page is nested under the **Previous Purchased** menu in **Account**.

The previously purchased products page is disabled by default, but you can enable it on two levels -- globally and per website. Once enabled, you can also set the number of days that the purchase history should cover.

.. note:: Please keep in mind that :ref:`visibility restrictions <products--product-visibility>` may affect the visibility of products for the previously purchased products page. Consequently, if the product is hidden for a specific website, category, customer group, etc., it will not be available on the previously purchased list.
