OroCommerce Design: Theme
=========================

In your Oro application, you can control and customize the storefront look and feel.

You can set the following theme-related options that apply globally by default:

* Pre-designed theme for the storefront
* Product and category image placeholders
* The layout for the product page details (default tabbed view, short, two column, or list)
* Style of the selector in filters
* Display mode for the user menu on the storefront

This can be done on three levels -- globally, per organization and website.

* :ref:`Configure Theme per Organization <configuration--commerce--design--theme--theme-settings--organization>`
* :ref:`Configure Theme per Website <configuration--commerce--design--theme--theme-settings--website>`
