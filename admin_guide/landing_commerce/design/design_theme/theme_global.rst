Configure Theme Globally
------------------------

To configure the storefront theme options globally:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Design > Theme** in the menu to the left.

   .. note:: For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

   The following page is displayed:

3. In the **Theme Settings** section, configure the following options:

   * **Theme** --- Select a theme from the list. The theme controls general design of the storefront that defines its look and feel. *Default*, *blank*, and *custom* themes are available out of the box for the storefront.

   .. hint:: For example, this is what the address book looks like in the storefront for the default and custom themes:

             **Default theme**

             .. image:: /frontstore_guide/img/profile/MyProfileAddressBooks.png

             **Custom theme**

             .. image:: /frontstore_guide/img/profile/address_book_compact.png

   * **Product Image Placeholder** ---- Select an image to be displayed on the product listing and product view pages for the products that do not have any associated images.
   * **Category Image Placeholder** --- Select an image to be used in various category widgets (e.g. Featured Categories) for the categories that do not have any associated images.

4. In the **Page Templates** section, select the product page template from the list. This page template is used to render the product page in the storefront by default, unless the template is overridden in the product details. *Default template* (tabbed), *Short page*, *Two-column page*, and *List page* templates are available out of the box. For preview and more information on these options, see the :ref:`Manage Product Page Design with Page Templates <user-guide--page-templates>` topic.

   Select the **Use Parent Scope Value** check box to use the default value.

5. In the **Filter Settings** section, specify how the multi-select filters should look in the storefront. Available options are *Drop-down* and *All at once*.

   .. hint:: This is what the user menu looks like for different values:

             **Drop-down**

             .. image:: /user_guide/system/img/configuration/filter_settings_dropdown.png

             **All at once**

             .. image:: /user_guide/system/img/configuration/filter_settings_allatonce.png

6. In the **Menu Templates** section, select the user menu display mode that defines the look and feel of the user menu in the storefront.

   .. hint:: This is what the user menu looks like for different values:

             **Show all items at once**

             .. image:: /admin_guide/img/frontend_menu/ShowAllItemsAtOnce.png

             **Show subitems in a popup**

             .. image:: /admin_guide/img/frontend_menu/ShowSubitemsInPopup.png
