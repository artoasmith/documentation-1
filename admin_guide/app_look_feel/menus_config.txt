Menus Configuration
===================

Description
-----------

This guide describes how to configure menus for the whole organization (or enterprise).

If you want to personalise menus for yourself only, open your profile, and select :guilabel:`Edit Menus` from the :guilabel:`More Actions` dropdown.

.. warning::
   For Enterprise Edition only:

   If your enterprise includes several organizations, changes made at **System>Menus** will affect all the organizations.

   To made changes only for a specific organization, navigate **System>User Management>Organization**, click the required organization, and on its view page, click :guilabel:`Edit Menu`.


.. important::
   The ability to configure menus is controlled by the two capabilities: **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration**.

   - To enable a user to personalise menus for themselves and configure menus for each organization individually, include the **Manage Menus** capability into the user role.

   - To enable a user to configure menus the whole enterprise (all organizations that exist in the Oro application) at once, in addition to the **Manage Menus** capability, include also the **Access system configuration** capability into the user role.

Menu Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open the menu configuration, you can see a list of menu items in the left panel of the page. A menu can be multi-level (as a default main menu, for example) with child menu items nested under a parent menu items (e.g. **Reports**, **Manage Custom** reports are child menu items of the **Reports&Segments** menu item in the main menu).

Menu items in a menu can be visually separated by a divider (a horizontal line). Dividers help you logically organize menu items.

.. note:: Some menus (or some menu levels) cannot display dividers. For example, if you add a divider to the first level of the main menu (**application_menu**), this divider will not be displayed.
