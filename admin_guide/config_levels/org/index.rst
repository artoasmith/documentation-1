System Configuration for Organization
=====================================

In OroCommerce, you can configure available system settings on four configuration levels: system, organization, website and user.

On organization level, there are a number of options that you can configure specifically for the organization, but which will not affect system-wide configuration or configuration for a particular user.

.. important:: Organization-level configuration settings can fall back to system settings. For this, select the **Use System** check box next to the selected option. To go back to the default organization-level settings, click **Reset** on the top right.

The following categories of settings are available for system configuration at organization level (follow the links for more information):
