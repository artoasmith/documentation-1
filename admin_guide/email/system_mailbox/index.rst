Manage System Mailboxes
=======================

System mailbox allows people who do not have access to the company mailbox addresses write to the company.

You can create several system mailboxes. For example, this can be a mailbox for support requests, business proposals, or order requests. 

You can define and modify the list of OroCRM users who have access to each of these mailboxes, automatically turn 
letters into cases or leads, and set-up auto-responses.

In OroCRM, you can create a system mailbox on two levels, globally and per organization:

* :ref:`Configure a System Mailbox Globally <admin-configuration-system-mailboxes-global>`
* :ref:`Configure a System Mailbox per Organization <admin-configuration-system-mailboxes-organization>`

.. note::
   See a short demo on `how to create and configure system mailboxes <https://oroinc.com/orocrm/media-library/create-configure-system-mailboxes>`_ in your Oro application, or continue reading the step-by-step guidance below.
