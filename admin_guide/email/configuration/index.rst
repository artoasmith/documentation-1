Configure Email Settings
========================

In OroCommerce, you can configure email related settings on four :ref:`levels <configuration--guide--config-levels>`, globally, per organization, per website, and per user. Based on the level where configuration has taken place, settings can fall back to other levels. For more information on configuration levels in the application, please see the :ref:`Configuration Layers topics <configuration--guide--config-levels>`.

All email settings are located in the system, organization, website, or user configuration settings menus, with the system settings on the global level containing the highest number of options:

* :ref:`Configure Email Settings Globally <admin-configuration-email-configuration-global>`

* :ref:`Configure Email Settings per Organization <admin-configuration-email-configuration-organization>`

* :ref:`Configure Email Settings for Website <admin-configuration-system-mailboxes-website>`

* :ref:`Configure Email Settings per User <admin-configuration-email-configuration-user>`
