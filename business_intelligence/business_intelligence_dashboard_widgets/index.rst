Dashboards and Widgets
======================

Dashboard is a default page you see after you log in. It is an adjustable view that may contain many :ref:`types of information blocks (widgets) <user-guide--business-intelligence--widgets--explore>`,
such as today's calendar, recent calls and emails, quick launchpad, etc. You can have several dashboards that serve different purposes and switch between them.

In this section you will learn how to easily customize existing dashboard or create a new one, as well as add and manage widgets in the Oro application.

     :widths: 10, 30

     "**Label**","Name used to refer to the dashboard in the system."
     "**Clone from**","Choose an existing dashboard to be used as a base for a new one. If you want to create a dashboard from the scratch, choose the *Blank Dashboard* option."
     "**Owner**","Limits the list of users who can manage the dashboard to the users, whose roles allow managing dashboards of the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, head of the department, etc.)"

#. To save the dashboard, click **Save and Close** on the top right.

Initially, the dashboard contains all the widgets of the dashboard it has been cloned from. Dashboards cloned from the Blank Dashboard will be empty.

Manage Widgets on a Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Widgets can be easily managed and filtered. A number of widgets can be created for various team members. For instance, a sales manager can create the same widgets for each sales rep within the organization to be able to see results of each sales rep’s work.

Manage widgets using the tools in their header:

.. image:: /user_guide/img/business_intelligence/dashboards_6.png

- The |IcDelete| Delete button --- delete the widget from the dashboard

- The |IcSettings| Settings button --- Click the button to adjust the widget. See the `Adjust Widget Settings`_ section for the options you can change.

The specified owner, date range and the `territory <https://oroinc.com/doc/orocrm/current/user-guide-sales-tools/b2b-sales/territory-management>`_ (if available for the entity) are displayed at the bottom of the widget:
