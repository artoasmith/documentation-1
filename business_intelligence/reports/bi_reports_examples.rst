Aggregate Data in the Report
----------------------------

Below is an example of a simple report that displays a particular budget per opportunity.

1. Once you set up the *Budget amount* column, click **Add** to add it into the **Columns** list.

2. Click **Save**.

3. You are now redirected to the report view that shows the opportunities with the known **Budget Amount**:

4. Click **Edit** to continue the report configuration.

Let us see what happens after we use the **Count** function for the **Opportunity Budget** column:

5. Click |IcEdit| to update the column and change the function for the **Budget amount** to *Count*.

Similarly, you can use sum, max, average, and min functions.

**Report Preview (Function = Sum)**

.. image:: /user_guide/img/business_intelligence/reports_examples_5.png

The sum of **Budget Amount** values of all opportunities makes $202,565.00.

**Report Preview (Function = Max)**

The biggest budget amount value of the opportunity is $9,902.00.

Use Simple Grouping by Value
----------------------------

You can group the information in the report by unique values in the column(s).

Use Grouping by Value at Multiple Levels
----------------------------------------

You can group records based on several columns (e.g. per opportunity status and the B2B customer name).

Now, you can see the calculated budget metrics (total, average, min, and max) for all the opportunities with the same status that belong to a specific customer.

.. hint::

    Once a report is generated, you can click the name of a column to sort all the data in the report by the specified field value (ascending or descending).

    Here is an example of the report ordered by the **Name** column:

    .. image:: /user_guide/img/business_intelligence/reports_examples_11.png

    As you can see in the outlined area, there are opportunities which are both in progress and lost for Albers Super Markets. You can view the budget details for the both groups.

.. note::

    If the customer's name is the most important part of the grouping, it might be reasonable to edit the report and move the column to make it first.
