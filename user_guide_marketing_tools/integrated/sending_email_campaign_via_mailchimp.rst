Oro applications supports an out-of-the-box integration with MailChimp, enabling you to:

* Map the Marketing Lists as segments in MailChimp and keep them synchronized.
* Use existing segments in MailChimp and import them to the Oro application.
* Schedule importing statistics of the MailChimp campaigns into Oro Application.

.. note:: To use MailChimp with the Oro application, ensure that all the necessary integration steps are completed. See :ref:`MailChimp Integration <user-guide-mc-integration>` for more information.

Prepare Data for the Campaign in Oro
------------------------------------

Email campaigns are based on data in marketing lists. 

To create a campaign in the Oro application, create a :ref:`Marketing List <user-guide-marketing-lists>` first. This list will create a segment on the MailChimp side:
 
1. Navigate to **Marketing > Marketing Lists > Create Marketing List** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Marketing List** on the top right. 
3. Complete the following fields:

   * **Name** --- The name used to refer to the marketing list in the system.       
   * **Description** --- Optional field. Can be filled with text to help you and other users understand the purpose of the list in future.   
   * **Entity** --- Data to be synchronized into the marketing list will depend on the selected entity.   
   * **Type** --- The type of marketing list update. *Dynamic* means that all changes you make to your marketing list are automatic. *On Demand*  means that updates are performed manually.
   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users that can manage the marketing list to the users, whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` allow managing marketing lists of the owner. 

   .. important:: You can add multiple columns to your marketing list in OroCRM but only First Name, Last Name and Email details are synced over to MailChimp.

4. Add email information to the marketing list to send an email campaign via MailChimp.

   * **List** --- Select your marketing list from the dropdown.
   * **Segment** --- Select the marketing list segment that you created previously. 
   
     .. note:: Make sure that you send your email campaign to a **segment** of the list, i.e. a selected number of contacts within the entire list of subscribers. Otherwise, the contacts will **not** get synced back to the Oro application.
 
     **Pre-Built Segments** section of the same page allows you to choose contacts based on subscriber engagement (New Subscribers, Active Subscribers, Inactive Subscribers), or customer behavior (Repeat Customers)  and demographics (available after connection to your store).

   * **Personalize the** *To* **field > Mere Tag** --- Select this check box to personalize the emails in your campaign. This adds relevance to your emails and helps avoid spam filters. You will be asked to include **Merge Tags** to your email. Merge tags are personalization options. They include the names of the subscribers you want to send your emails to. In the provided field, specify merge tags for your recipients, i.e. \*\|FNAME\|\* or \*\|FNAME\|\* \*\|LNAME\|\*\ **.**

   Click **Save** to proceed to the next step.

4. **Content** --- Click **Design Email** to add content for your email. You will be redirected to a new page to select a pre-set campaign template or

   To ensure that your address each of your contacts by name, select **Merge Tags** and **First Name** in the options within **Content** text window.

   Here, you check out subscriber activity for your newly created email campaign.

Receive Campaign Statistics on the Oro Side
-------------------------------------------

Once you have sent out your email campaign in MailChimp, information about your email campaign should have been exported to OroCRM.

As soon as export has been completed, your email campaign should appear in **Marketing > Email Campaigns.** By clicking on your recent campaign,
you will be able to see subscriber activity statistics, such as the number of clicks, bounces, opens, etc. Numbers in each column for each
contact define the number of times an action has been performed, e.g. 2 opened, 1 click, 1 unsubscribe. These statistics will help you understand the outcome of your campaign and let you filter contacts for the next one.

.. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/mc_email_campaign/o_email_campaign_info.jpg
   :alt: Receive campaign statistics on the Oro application side

.. note:: Please note that sometimes Mailchimp's summary information may not match the OroCRM summary in the same report. This may happen because one set of statistics comes from Mailchimp directly. The other is generated as we receive specific reporting data back about recipients.

For instance, if you need to exclude customers who did not open your email from the next campaign, go to **Marketing > Marketing List> Create New Marketing List.** Fill in the mandatory fields, remembering to include at least one contact column below.

In the :ref:`Filters <user-guide-getting-started-filters>` section:

1. Drag **Apply Segment** to the field on the right.
2. Choose the list that you used for your previous campaign.
3. Drag **Field Condition** to set the conditions to the list.
4. Select **Contact > Contact Method (Contact) > Contact (Magento Customer) > Marketing List (Email Campaign) > Email Campaign (MailChimp Campaign) > Opens.**
5. Select **Field Value.** In our case, it is 0.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/marketing/mc_email_campaign/o_segment_opens_zero.jpg
      :alt: Select field value in filters

   The same way you can apply any conditions of your choice.

6. When you are done, click **Save and Close**.

This list is now displayed on the **Marketing List** :ref:`Page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` and contains contacts sorted according to your conditions.
